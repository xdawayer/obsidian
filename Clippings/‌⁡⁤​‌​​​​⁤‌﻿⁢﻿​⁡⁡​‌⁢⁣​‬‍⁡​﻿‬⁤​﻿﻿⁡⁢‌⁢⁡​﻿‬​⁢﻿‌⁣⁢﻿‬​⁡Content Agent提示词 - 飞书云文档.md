Title: How to Track Your Mood with Astrology: A Beginner’s Guide to Emotional Transits

Introduction

Hook: Do you ever feel emotionally overwhelmed or energized without a clear reason? It might not be you; it might be the stars.

Direct Answer (Important): Provide a concise definition (40-60 words) explaining that tracking mood with astrology involves monitoring the Moon's phase and its current Zodiac sign. Explain that since the Moon governs emotions, aligning your daily feelings with the Moon's position helps identify recurring emotional patterns.

Why Astrology Reflects Your Emotions

Explain the role of the Moon in a birth chart (representing the subconscious, instincts, and inner mood).

Briefly explain why looking at your Sun sign is not enough for emotional tracking.

Step-by-Step: How to Start Tracking

Step 1: Find Your Natal Moon Sign. (Explain that this is your emotional "baseline").

Step 2: Check Today’s Moon Sign. (Explain that the Moon changes signs every ~2.5 days).

Step 3: Log Your Data. Provide a simple text format for a daily entry:

Date

Current Moon Sign & Phase

My Mood (1-10 scale)

Key Emotion (e.g., Anxious, Productive, Calm)

Reference Guide: The 12 Moon Signs & Emotional Tendencies

Create a structured table or list for all 12 signs. For each sign, describe the typical mood focus.

Taurus: Grounded, seeking comfort, slow-moving.

Gemini: Mentally active, chatty, scattered.

Cancer: Sensitive, nurturing, moody.

Leo: Expressive, seeks validation, dramatic.

# Relating — Deep Reading Notes

> Liz Greene's 1977 classic dismantles the popular astrology of "compatibility" and rebuilds it from the ground up as a psychology of projection. The person you fall in love with, the partner who drives you mad, the friend whose qualities simultaneously fascinate and irritate you — none of these are accidents, and none of them are simply other people. They are mirrors. Drawing on Jung's theory of the contrasexual archetype and the mechanism of projection, Greene argues that the birth chart, particularly the Descendant, the seventh house, and the placements of Venus, Mars, Moon, and Sun, maps the precise dimensions of your own psyche that you are unable to own and therefore compelled to seek in others. Relationships become the theater in which your unlived life stages itself, and the chart becomes the script you did not know you were following. The book is at once a guide to synastry, a meditation on the psychology of love, and an argument that every significant relationship is ultimately an encounter with yourself.

## What This Book Illuminates

Before Greene, astrological relationship analysis was largely a matter of sign compatibility: Aries goes well with Leo, Cancer clashes with Aquarius. Synastry existed, but it tended to operate at the level of prediction — will this marriage last, will these two people get along? Greene swept that entire approach aside. She asked not whether two people are compatible but what unconscious drama their meeting activates. The question shifted from "will this work?" to "what is this relationship trying to teach you about yourself?"

This was a radical move in 1977, and its influence on subsequent psychological astrology cannot be overstated. Greene was among the first to integrate Jung's understanding of projection, anima and animus, and the shadow into a systematic astrological framework for relationships. She showed that the seventh house does not describe your future partner the way a catalog describes merchandise. It describes the qualities within you that have been exiled from consciousness, that you cannot see in yourself and therefore must encounter in others. The Descendant is not a wish list. It is a mirror held up to your blind spot.

The book sits at a crossroads in the history of astrology. Behind it lies the tradition of synastry as compatibility analysis. Ahead of it lies the entire movement of psychological astrology applied to relationships — the work of Stephen Arroyo, Howard Sasportas, and later practitioners who took for granted what Greene had to argue into existence. Her unique contribution was to make the case, with clinical precision and literary elegance, that you cannot understand any relationship until you understand what you are projecting into it, and you cannot understand what you are projecting until you read your own chart with honest eyes.

## Key Concepts

The book is built on a framework of interlocking ideas that transform how you understand both astrology and relationships.

The first is projection as the engine of attraction. Greene argues that whatever psychological qualities you cannot integrate within yourself — because they were discouraged in childhood, because they conflict with your self-image, because they belong to the gender you were taught not to embody — will be projected outward onto the people closest to you. You do not simply find a partner. You find a screen onto which you can cast the parts of yourself you have disowned, and the intensity of the attraction is often proportional to the completeness of the projection.

The second concept is the contrasexual archetype. Following Jung, Greene maps the anima — the inner feminine image in a man's psyche — primarily through the Moon and Venus, and the animus — the inner masculine image in a woman's psyche — through the Sun and Mars. These inner figures shape your experience of the opposite sex, your romantic ideals, your patterns of falling in love. When you are swept off your feet by someone, you are often encountering the external embodiment of an internal image you have carried since childhood.

Third is the element as relationship language. Greene analyzes the four elements — fire, earth, air, water — not as personality types but as fundamental modes of engaging with experience. When your chart is dominated by one element and deficient in another, the missing element becomes a source of fascination and discomfort, and you are drawn to people who carry what you lack. The chemistry between elemental combinations is the chemistry of complementarity and friction, of being completed and being challenged.

Fourth is Saturn as the binding agent in relationship. Where Venus describes attraction and Mars describes desire, Saturn describes commitment, responsibility, and the pressure that makes relationships last long enough for genuine psychological work to occur. Saturn contacts in synastry are not romantic, but they are the glue without which the relationship dissolves before it can serve its deeper purpose.

## Deep Dive: Psychological Dynamics

### The Other as Mirror

Greene opens the book's psychological architecture with a proposition that is simple to state and difficult to absorb: the person sitting across from you in your most intimate relationship is, to a significant degree, a creation of your own unconscious. This is not to say that the other person does not exist or that their qualities are imaginary. It is to say that what you perceive in them, what draws you toward them or repels you, what you fall in love with and what you eventually resent, is filtered through the lens of your own unacknowledged inner life.

The seventh house is where this dynamic is mapped most directly. The sign on the Descendant and any planets in the seventh house describe the qualities you tend to experience through others rather than expressing directly. If Scorpio occupies your Descendant, the intensity, depth, and desire for psychological truth that belong to Scorpio are present in your psyche but may be exiled from your conscious self-image — particularly if your Ascendant is Taurus and you identify with stability, simplicity, and material comfort. You then reliably attract partners who are intense, probing, emotionally demanding, and you may spend years complaining about their complexity without recognizing that you selected them precisely because they embody what you have refused to develop in yourself.

Greene traces this dynamic through multiple sign polarities with a precision that elevates the analysis far beyond simple cookbook astrology. The Aries-Libra axis involves a tension between self-assertion and accommodation. The person with Libra rising may present a gracious, harmonious exterior while projecting all their Mars-like aggression, competitiveness, and self-interest onto partners who then appear dominating or selfish. The Leo-Aquarius axis plays out the tension between personal specialness and collective belonging. The Virgo-Pisces axis sets up the dialogue between analytical control and surrendered imagination.

What makes Greene's treatment psychologically powerful is her insistence that the projection is not a mistake to be corrected but a stage in a developmental process. You cannot begin the work of integration until the projection has occurred, until you have encountered your own disowned material in the flesh of another human being and been forced to reckon with it. The partner who embodies your projection is not an obstacle to your growth. They are the instrument of it.

### The Four Elements and the Chemistry of Relating

Greene devotes substantial chapters to the four elements, and her treatment goes far deeper than the familiar characterizations. She is not interested in telling you that fire signs are passionate and earth signs are practical. She is interested in showing you that each element represents a fundamentally different way of apprehending reality, and that the gaps in your own elemental balance create both your deepest attractions and your most intractable relationship conflicts.

A chart dominated by fire and air, for example, belongs to someone who lives primarily through inspiration, vision, ideals, and intellectual constructs. The world of physical sensation and emotional depth — the territory of earth and water — may feel foreign, threatening, or simply uninteresting. But the psyche demands wholeness. What you have excluded from your conscious orientation does not vanish. It sinks into the unconscious and acquires a compensatory charge, and you find yourself drawn to people who live in the very element you have neglected. The fiery, airy person falls in love with someone earthy and watery, enchanted by their groundedness or their emotional depth, and the initial fascination gradually gives way to frustration as the very qualities that attracted you begin to feel like limitations on your freedom.

Greene is particularly astute about the way elemental attraction operates through idealization and disappointment. The water-dominant person who lacks fire may worship a partner's confidence and vitality, experiencing through them the spontaneous self-expression they cannot access within themselves. But the partner is not a symbol. They are a person with their own needs, and eventually the projection wears thin. The fire person's confidence starts to look like insensitivity. Their spontaneity starts to look like recklessness. What was once enchanting becomes a source of grievance, and the relationship enters a crisis that is actually a crisis of projection — the moment when you must decide whether to reclaim what you projected or simply discard the partner and find a new screen.

Greene also analyzes what happens when two people share the same elemental emphasis. Two fire-dominant people may experience an immediate sense of recognition and mutual excitement, a shared language of enthusiasm and possibility. But the very ease of the connection means that the missing elements — the emotional depth, the practical grounding — remain unaddressed. The relationship may burn brilliantly but lack the substance to endure. Two water-dominant people may create an extraordinarily intimate emotional bond but struggle with the practical demands of daily life or find themselves drowning together in feeling without the detachment necessary to gain perspective. Greene does not treat any combination as inherently better or worse. She treats each as a specific psychological situation with its own gifts and its own dangers, and she insists that understanding the situation is the first step toward working with it rather than being governed by it.

### Venus and Mars: The Dance of Desire and Value

Greene's treatment of Venus and Mars in the context of relationship constitutes one of the book's most practically illuminating sections. She reads Venus not as a generic indicator of "love" but as the function that evaluates, appreciates, and assigns worth — it describes what you find beautiful, what you value, what you are willing to invest yourself in. Mars, conversely, is the function that desires, pursues, and acts — it describes how you go after what you want, how you assert yourself, and what ignites your passion.

Venus in an earth sign, for example, describes someone whose experience of love is rooted in the tangible and the sensory. Physical presence, reliability, concrete acts of care, the beauty of natural forms — these are the things that make this person feel loved. Venus in an air sign, by contrast, locates value in intellectual connection, in the exchange of ideas, in the shared appreciation of cultural life. These two Venus types may love each other deeply yet consistently fail to make the other feel loved, because they are offering what they themselves value rather than what the other person needs.

Mars carries a similar specificity. Mars in Scorpio pursues with intensity, persistence, and an emotional depth that borders on obsession. Mars in Gemini pursues through wit, versatility, and the stimulation of mental engagement. When Mars in Scorpio desires you, you feel it as a consuming force. When Mars in Gemini desires you, you feel it as a quickening of intellectual curiosity. Neither is more or less valid, but they speak different languages of desire, and the failure to recognize that difference is behind many relationship conflicts that seem inexplicable from the outside.

Greene weaves Venus and Mars together by showing how they operate as a pair within each individual chart. When Venus and Mars are in compatible signs, your capacity for desire and your sense of value are aligned — what you want and what you appreciate tend to converge on the same kind of person or experience. When they are in signs that clash, you may find yourself attracted to one type of person while falling in love with a very different type, creating a pattern of divided loyalties or serial relationships in which each partner satisfies one function while leaving the other starving.

### The Contrasexual Archetype: Anima and Animus

This section represents the book's deepest engagement with Jungian theory and its most controversial claims. Greene argues, following Jung, that every individual carries within the psyche an image of the other sex — an internal figure that is part instinct, part personal history, and part collective archetype. In a man, this figure is the anima, and Greene maps it primarily through the Moon and Venus. In a woman, it is the animus, mapped through the Sun and Mars. These figures shape your experience of romantic love with a power that conscious intention cannot match.

When a man with Moon in Pisces encounters a woman who seems to embody Piscean qualities — dreaminess, compassion, artistic sensitivity, a certain elusive quality that promises redemption — he is not simply attracted to a person. He is recognizing his own anima projected outward. The attraction carries a numinous quality, a sense of destiny or enchantment, because it is not merely interpersonal. It is intrapsychic. He is encountering a part of his own soul in the form of another human being. Greene is unflinching about the consequences: the person carrying the projection is never identical to the archetype. The real woman is not his anima. She is herself, with her own complexity, her own needs, her own shadow. The enchantment inevitably breaks down, and what follows depends on whether the man can begin to recognize the anima as his own inner figure or whether he discards the woman and goes looking for a more perfect embodiment of the image.

Greene traces the same dynamic for the animus. A woman with Sun in Capricorn and Mars in Scorpio may carry an inner masculine image that combines authority, ambition, emotional intensity, and a certain ruthlessness. She may be drawn to men who embody these qualities, experiencing them as powerful and magnetic, only to find herself consistently in relationships with partners who are dominating, controlling, or emotionally unavailable. The outer partner is reflecting an inner figure, and until she recognizes the authority and intensity as qualities she needs to develop within herself rather than sourcing from a man, the pattern will repeat.

Greene is careful to note that these dynamics are not limited to heterosexual relationships, though the language of her era sometimes makes it difficult to see past the gender binary. The underlying principle is that whatever you cannot own as your own psychological quality will be sought in someone else, and the contrasexual archetype is simply the most powerful and most common form this projection takes. The path toward integration does not require the elimination of attraction to others. It requires an increasing awareness that what enchants you in another person often has its origin within your own psyche.

### Saturn: The Weight That Holds the Frame

Greene's treatment of Saturn in relationships continues and extends the work she began in her earlier book on the planet. In the context of relating, Saturn serves a paradoxical function. It is the planet least associated with romance — it brings obligation, inhibition, seriousness, and the weight of reality — yet it is the planet most responsible for relationships that endure long enough to become psychologically transformative.

When Saturn appears prominently in synastry — when one person's Saturn conjuncts, squares, or opposes a personal planet in the other person's chart — the relationship takes on a quality of seriousness that is difficult to ignore or walk away from. There is a sense of obligation, of karmic weight, of something that must be worked through rather than enjoyed. Greene describes Saturn contacts as creating a container for the relationship, a structure within which the more volatile energies of Venus, Mars, and the outer planets can do their work without the relationship flying apart at the first sign of difficulty.

The person whose Saturn falls on your Sun may evoke in you the feeling of being judged, limited, or held to a standard you can never meet. You may experience them as the critical parent, the authority figure who sees your inadequacies, the one person in whose presence you cannot relax. Yet the very discomfort of this dynamic pushes you toward a maturity you might otherwise avoid. The Saturn person demands that you become real, that you stop performing and start being, and while the demand often feels oppressive, it may also be exactly what you need.

Greene also explores how Saturn contacts create the phenomenon of staying in a relationship past the point of enchantment. Venus brought you together. Mars generated the passion. But Saturn is what keeps you there when the passion cools, when the projections begin to dissolve, when you start to see the other person as they actually are rather than as your anima or animus image. This is the moment when the real relationship begins — and it can begin only because Saturn has provided the gravity that prevented you from floating away when the fantasy ended. Greene's point is not that all Saturn-heavy relationships are healthy or worth preserving. It is that without Saturn's binding quality, no relationship lasts long enough for the deeper psychological work to occur.

### The Eighth House and the Territory of Fusion

Beyond the seventh house of partnership, Greene explores the eighth house as the domain where relationship moves from encounter into merger. The eighth house governs what happens when two separate people attempt to become one — the sharing of resources, the vulnerability of sexual intimacy, the psychological nakedness that comes from truly allowing another person to know you. It is also the house of death and transformation, and Greene draws the connection explicitly: in genuine intimacy, something in each person must die. The defended self, the carefully maintained image, the emotional autonomy you relied on for safety — all of these are threatened by the eighth house demand for fusion.

Greene treats eighth house themes not as separate from seventh house dynamics but as their deepening. The seventh house is where you meet the other. The eighth house is where the meeting goes all the way down. Planets in the eighth house describe the specific dimensions of psyche that are activated when intimacy reaches this depth. Pluto in the eighth house intensifies the experience to its extreme — the desire for total merging, the terror of annihilation, the power struggles that erupt when two people are close enough to truly wound each other. Venus in the eighth house brings an experience of love that is inseparable from loss, as though every act of opening also contains the knowledge that what you have opened yourself to can be taken away.

The sexual dimension of the eighth house receives sustained attention. Greene treats sexuality not as a separate category of experience but as the physical expression of the same psychological dynamics that operate everywhere else in the chart. Your sexual patterns, your fantasies, your capacity for physical surrender or your need for control — all of these are legible in the chart, particularly through Mars, Pluto, and the eighth house. The intimate act becomes a concentrated theater of projection, vulnerability, power, and transformation, and Greene reads it with the same psychological seriousness she brings to every other dimension of relating.

## Dialogue with Jungian Psychology

Greene's engagement with Jung in this book goes beyond application. She is using astrology to solve a problem that Jungian psychology alone cannot fully address: the problem of why you project onto this particular person, in this particular way, at this particular time in your life. Jung described the mechanism of projection with great clarity — you disown a quality and encounter it in another — but the theory in its pure form cannot explain why your projections take the specific form they do. Greene demonstrates that the birth chart answers this question with startling precision. Your Moon sign tells you the specific quality of the anima you will project. Your seventh house tells you the specific type of person who will catch the projection. Your Saturn contacts in synastry tell you which relationships will hold the projection long enough for you to work with it.

The concept of individuation — Jung's term for the process of becoming a whole, integrated personality — runs through the book as a quiet organizing principle. For Jung, individuation requires the integration of the shadow, the contrasexual archetype, and ultimately the Self. Greene shows that relationships are the primary theater in which this integration occurs, not through solitary introspection but through the friction, enchantment, and disillusionment of life with another person. Every failed projection, every disenchantment with a partner who turns out to be merely human, every confrontation with qualities you despise in someone else and then discover in yourself — these are the steps of individuation enacted in the relational field.

Greene also develops Jung's concept of the shadow with considerable nuance. In the context of relating, the shadow is not only what you have repressed but what you have been culturally conditioned to exile. A woman raised to be accommodating and sweet may carry her aggression, ambition, and intellectual authority as shadow material, encountering these qualities only in the men she chooses. A man taught that emotional vulnerability is weakness may project his Moon — his capacity for feeling, for receptivity, for nurturing — onto the women in his life. The chart reveals not only the content of the shadow but the cultural and familial forces that created it, giving the work of integration a specificity that generic shadow work cannot achieve.

## Reading Your Own Chart

Begin with the Descendant — the sign on the cusp of your seventh house. This sign describes the qualities you are most likely to project onto intimate partners. Sit with it honestly. If your Descendant is in Sagittarius, ask yourself where the adventurer, the philosopher, the restless seeker lives within you. If you cannot find that energy in yourself but keep falling for people who embody it, the projection is likely active.

Next, look at any planets in the seventh house. These describe specific energies that you tend to experience through others. Neptune there suggests you idealize partners and then suffer when they turn out to be human. Mars there suggests you encounter your own assertion and anger primarily through the people closest to you.

Examine Venus and Mars by sign. When you see Venus square Saturn in your chart, consider how your experience of love may be shadowed by a sense of unworthiness, a fear that affection must be earned through sacrifice or withheld as punishment. When Mars opposes Neptune, notice how your capacity for direct desire may dissolve into confusion, fantasy, or passive withdrawal — and how you may then attract partners who act out the directness you have surrendered.

Look at the Moon if you are a man, at the Sun and Mars if you are a woman, with the understanding that these carry the contrasexual archetype. The sign of your Moon or Sun describes the inner image you project onto lovers, the template against which every potential partner is unconsciously measured. Recognizing this image as your own — as a quality you are developing, not a quality you need someone else to provide — is the central psychological task Greene outlines.

Finally, check for Saturn contacts in any significant relationship by comparing charts. Where Saturn falls tells you where the pressure is, and pressure, however uncomfortable, is often the sign that genuine work is being asked of you.

## Limitations and Caveats

Greene's framework is deeply indebted to a mid-twentieth-century Jungian model that carries certain assumptions. The anima-animus theory, as Greene presents it, operates within a gender binary that does not adequately account for the full spectrum of gender identity and sexual orientation. Readers outside the heterosexual framework will find the underlying principle — that you project unintegrated qualities onto those you desire — entirely sound, but the specific mapping of Moon-Venus to anima and Sun-Mars to animus will need adaptation.

The book also reflects the cultural moment of its writing. Relationship dynamics in 1977 were shaped by a particular set of gender expectations, and some of Greene's examples carry those assumptions in ways that are visible from a contemporary vantage point. The psychological insights transcend their era, but the social scaffolding does not always travel.

Greene's focus on the unconscious dimensions of relationship, while illuminating, can also leave practical questions unanswered. The book tells you with great precision what you are projecting and why, but it is less interested in the daily work of sustaining a partnership once the projections have been recognized. The move from insight to practice is left largely to the reader.

## Further Reading

Howard Sasportas's *The Twelve Houses* provides detailed psychological readings of the seventh and eighth houses that complement Greene's framework. Greene's own *Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil* deepens the understanding of Saturn's role in binding relationships. Stephen Arroyo's *Astrology, Psychology, and the Four Elements* offers a parallel exploration of elemental dynamics that expands on Greene's treatment. For a fuller engagement with the Jungian dimension, Greene and Sasportas's *The Development of the Personality* extends the analysis of projection, the inner child, and relationship patterns into the broader territory of psychological growth.

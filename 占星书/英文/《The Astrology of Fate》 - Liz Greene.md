# The Astrology of Fate — Deep Reading Notes

> Liz Greene's 1984 masterwork poses astrology's most ancient and uncomfortable question: how much of your life is fated, and how much is free? Rather than choosing a side, Greene takes you into the underworld of the psyche itself, arguing through Greek mythology, Jungian depth psychology, and decades of clinical astrological practice that what you experience as "fate" — the recurring crises, the uncanny repetitions, the relationships that seem scripted by forces beyond your control — is largely the work of your own unconscious. Pluto is her primary guide through this territory: the planet of death, rebirth, compulsion, and transformation that traditional astrology feared and modern astrology often sanitizes. Greene does neither. She treats Pluto as the astrological face of Moira, the Greek personification of destiny, and shows how this planet's placement in your chart marks the precise domain where you will be dragged into the underworld of your own unlived life. The book is simultaneously a meditation on the philosophy of fate, a reinterpretation of Pluto through all twelve signs, and a sustained argument that becoming conscious of your psychological patterns is the only authentic form of freedom.

## What This Book Illuminates

The central insight of this book is that the line between fate and character is not a line at all. Greene draws on the ancient Greek understanding that your daimon — your allotted portion, the particular pattern of your soul — is not something imposed on you from outside but something that expresses itself through you, most powerfully through the parts of yourself you refuse to see. What you will not face inwardly, you meet outwardly. The partner who betrays you, the crisis that arrives unbidden, the compulsive behavior you cannot stop despite knowing better — these are not random misfortunes. They are the unconscious, speaking in the only language it has available when consciousness refuses to listen.

This reframes the entire question of astrological determinism. If your fate is the exteriorization of your own shadow, then the chart is not a sentence but a mirror. It shows you what you are doing to yourself, beneath the threshold of awareness, and it shows you where the pressure to become conscious is most intense. Greene does not promise that consciousness dissolves all suffering — she is far too honest for that — but she argues that unconscious suffering and conscious suffering are qualitatively different experiences. The person who understands why the pattern keeps repeating inhabits a different relationship to that pattern than the person who simply endures it as inexplicable bad luck.

The book also illuminates how myth functions as psychological cartography. Greene reads the Greek gods not as quaint ancient stories but as precise maps of psychic territory. When she retells the myth of Pluto's abduction of Persephone, she is not decorating a psychological insight with literary imagery — she is showing you that the myth is the insight, preserved in narrative form across millennia because it describes something real about how the psyche works. The descent into the underworld, the loss of innocence, the eventual return carrying knowledge that was unavailable in the sunlit world above — this is what Pluto transits feel like from the inside, and the myth knew it before psychology had a name for it.

## Key Concepts

The book is organized around several ideas that interlock to form a single, coherent vision of how fate operates through the birth chart.

The first is Moira, the Greek concept of fate that Greene distinguishes sharply from the modern notion of determinism. Moira is not a script written before your birth that you are powerless to alter. It is closer to a pattern — a particular shape of soul that seeks expression and will find it one way or another. If you cooperate with Moira consciously, you experience your life as meaningful, even when it is difficult. If you resist Moira unconsciously, you experience the same pattern as persecution from outside, as though life keeps doing the same terrible thing to you for no reason. The distinction between cooperation and resistance is, for Greene, the only real freedom available within a fated life.

The second concept is the **shadow as the engine of fate**. Drawing directly on Jung, Greene argues that whatever you banish from consciousness does not disappear. It goes underground and returns in projected form — as the qualities you hate in others, as the situations that keep finding you, as the compulsions you cannot explain. Pluto in the chart marks the specific territory where this dynamic is most active, where the shadow is densest and the compulsion to project it outward is strongest.

The third is the understanding of Pluto as the astrological embodiment of Moira. Greene treats Pluto not as one planet among many but as the planet most directly connected to the experience of fate. Where Saturn teaches through limitation and delay, Pluto teaches through crisis, obsession, and the death of what you clung to. Pluto does not trim or adjust — it annihilates, and from the annihilation, something new is born. The specific sign and house Pluto occupies in your chart describe the domain where this death-and-rebirth pattern will recur throughout your life.

The fourth concept is the relationship between personal and collective fate. Because Pluto moves slowly, spending roughly twelve to thirty years in each sign, its sign placement is shared by an entire generation. Greene reads this as a collective fate — each generation carries a particular shadow, a particular domain of unconscious material that it must confront. The house placement of Pluto, however, is individual, and it is here that the collective theme becomes personal, touching the specific area of your life where the generational darkness enters your private story.

## Deep Dive: Psychological Dynamics

### Fate as the Return of the Repressed

Greene's most penetrating argument is that fate is not what happens to you but what you do to yourself without knowing it. This is a radical reframing. Most people experience their most painful life events as coming from outside — the illness, the betrayal, the financial catastrophe, the relationship that collapsed despite every effort to sustain it. Greene does not deny the reality of these events, but she insists that the pattern behind them originates in the psyche. Something in you attracted, created, or participated in the situation, and that something is precisely what you have been unwilling to acknowledge.

This is not blame. Greene is meticulous in distinguishing between conscious choice and unconscious compulsion. You did not choose to attract the abusive partner or the financial ruin. But something in your unconscious — a belief absorbed in childhood, a family pattern inherited across generations, a piece of your own nature that you were taught to despise — drew you toward it with the force of gravity. The unconscious does not operate through rational decision-making. It operates through attraction, repulsion, fascination, and dread, and it uses the circumstances of your life as its theater.

This understanding transforms the meaning of astrological transits. When Pluto transits a sensitive point in your chart, you do not simply "have a difficult time." You enter a period when the unconscious material associated with that chart point is forced to the surface. The specific events may vary — a death, a divorce, a breakdown, an obsessive entanglement — but the underlying dynamic is the same: what was hidden is being revealed, whether you want it revealed or not. Greene argues that the intensity of the experience is directly proportional to the degree of prior unconsciousness. The more thoroughly you have buried the material, the more violently it erupts when Pluto disturbs the ground.

### The Mythology of the Moirai

Greene devotes the opening section of the book to a sustained exploration of the Greek Moirai — the three sisters Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, who spin, measure, and cut the thread of each human life. This is not antiquarian digression. Greene uses the myth to establish that the Western understanding of fate has always been more complex than simple determinism. The Greeks did not believe that human beings were puppets. They believed that each life had a particular portion, a particular allotment, and that the relationship between the individual and that allotment was the defining drama of existence.

Clotho spins the thread — she represents the raw material of your nature, the given, what you were born with and cannot change. Lachesis measures the thread — she represents the unfolding of that nature through time, the way your allotment reveals itself in the specific circumstances of your life. Atropos cuts the thread — she represents the limit, the inescapable boundary, the fact that your particular pattern has a shape and that shape has edges. Greene reads these three figures as corresponding to the natal chart (Clotho), the progressed and transiting chart (Lachesis), and the ultimate boundary of death and irreversible change (Atropos).

What makes this mythological framing psychologically powerful is that the Moirai were older than the Olympian gods. Even Zeus could not overrule them. This detail matters. It tells you that fate, in the Greek imagination, was not a divine punishment or reward but a structural principle of reality itself — something that predated the gods and constrained even them. When Greene transposes this into psychological terms, the implication is clear: the unconscious patterns that shape your life are older and deeper than your conscious will. You cannot simply decide to be different. You must go down into the territory where the pattern lives and encounter it on its own terms.

### Pluto and the Underworld Journey

The heart of the book is Greene's treatment of Pluto, and she approaches it through the myth of Hades and Persephone with a depth and seriousness that transformed how a generation of astrologers understood this planet. The myth is familiar: Persephone, the maiden daughter of Demeter, is gathering flowers in a meadow when the earth opens and Hades seizes her, dragging her down to the underworld to be his queen. Demeter's grief causes the earth to become barren. Eventually a compromise is reached — Persephone will spend part of each year below and part above — but the girl who returns is no longer the girl who was taken. She has eaten the pomegranate seeds. She belongs, in part, to the darkness now.

Greene reads this myth as the fundamental Plutonian experience. Something in your life — your innocence, your security, your sense of control, your identity as you understood it — is seized and taken into the dark. You did not choose this. You did not volunteer. The earth opened. And the sojourn in the underworld, however terrifying, accomplishes something that no amount of voluntary self-improvement could achieve: it puts you in contact with a dimension of your own nature that the daylight world does not permit. Persephone returns as queen of the dead, carrying authority that the maiden could never have possessed.

This is Greene's essential point about Pluto: the transformation it offers is not available through any other means. You cannot get to the underworld by deciding to go. You get there by being taken. The events that drag you down — the obsessions, the losses, the encounters with power and powerlessness, the confrontations with mortality — are not obstacles to growth. They are the growth, happening in the only way it can.

Greene traces this dynamic through Pluto's placement in each of the twelve signs. Pluto in Leo, for instance, describes a generation whose shadow lies in the domain of creative self-expression, personal authority, and the desire for specialness. The compulsive dimension of this placement might manifest as an obsessive need to be seen, a terror of being ordinary, or a destructive pattern in which creative projects are abandoned the moment they fail to produce the anticipated recognition. The fate associated with this placement involves a confrontation with the ego's hunger for glory and a death of the fantasy that personal significance depends on external validation.

Pluto in Virgo carries the shadow into the realm of service, health, work, and the compulsion toward perfection. Here the fated crisis often involves the body — illness or breakdown that forces a reckoning with the limits of control — or a collapse of the carefully constructed systems by which the individual managed anxiety. The descent into the underworld for this generation involves discovering that imperfection is not a deficiency to be corrected but a condition of being alive, and that the compulsive pursuit of purity is itself a form of violence against the self.

Pluto in Libra takes the shadow into relationship. The generation born with this placement carries an unconscious intensity around partnership, justice, and the balance of power between people. The fated encounters often involve discovering that you have projected your own power onto a partner and then resenting that partner for wielding it, or that your pursuit of harmony has been a disguised attempt to avoid the conflict necessary for genuine intimacy. The underworld journey here strips away the social mask and reveals the raw truth of what you actually need from another person, which is often very different from what you were taught to want.

Pluto in Scorpio, the sign of its own rulership, intensifies every Plutonian theme to its extreme. This generation carries a shadow that involves the very mechanisms of psychological defense — denial, projection, manipulation, the use of secrecy as power. The fate here is circular in a particularly disorienting way: the tool you use to avoid the underworld is itself the underworld. The compulsion toward emotional control, the fascination with what is hidden or taboo, the oscillation between intimacy and isolation — these are not problems to be solved from outside but the terrain of the descent itself. Greene suggests that for this placement, the confrontation with Pluto is the most direct and the least avoidable of any sign, precisely because there is no comfortable distance between the person and the archetype.

Pluto in Cancer, which Greene discusses with particular care given its connection to the generation that lived through the World Wars, carries the shadow into the realm of home, family, belonging, and emotional security. The fated pattern here involves a disruption of roots — literal displacement through war or migration, or the psychological experience of never feeling at home anywhere. The compulsion takes the form of clinging to family bonds that have become suffocating, or severing those bonds entirely and spending a lifetime haunted by the absence. The underworld journey demands a redefinition of what safety means, one that cannot depend on the permanence of any external home.

### The Compulsion to Repeat

One of Greene's most psychologically acute observations is that fate often takes the form of repetition. The same type of partner. The same dynamic with authority figures. The same crisis arriving in different clothing every seven or ten or twenty years. Freud called this the repetition compulsion — the psyche's tendency to re-create unresolved situations in an unconscious attempt to master them — and Greene places it at the center of her understanding of astrological fate.

The natal chart, in this reading, is not a static description but a dynamic pattern that generates repetition. Your Pluto placement describes the specific compulsion. Your Saturn placement describes where you encounter the same wall again and again. The aspects between planets describe the internal dialogues that replay in situation after situation. And the transits — especially Pluto transits — describe the moments when the repetition becomes so intense that it can no longer be ignored, when the pattern breaks through the surface of your managed life and demands to be seen.

Greene's clinical examples are devastating in their precision. She describes clients who married the same psychological partner three or four times, each time convinced that this one was different. She describes individuals whose careers followed the same arc of initial brilliance followed by self-sabotage, over and over, in different fields. She describes family patterns that transmitted across generations — the grandmother's unspoken grief becoming the mother's depression becoming the daughter's eating disorder — each manifestation carrying the same archetypal signature but wearing a different face.

The repetition stops, Greene argues, only when it becomes conscious. Not when you decide it should stop, not when you resolve to make better choices, but when you actually see the pattern from inside — when you catch yourself in the act of re-creating it and understand, in your body and not just your intellect, what you are doing and why. This moment of recognition is what she means by encountering fate consciously. The pattern may not disappear. But your relationship to it shifts from victimhood to participation, from being dragged by the current to swimming in it.

### Power, Control, and Surrender

Pluto's domain includes the dynamics of power, and Greene explores this territory with unflinching honesty. She observes that most people have a deeply ambivalent relationship with power. You want it and fear it. You resent those who have it over you and are terrified of wielding it yourself. You may spend your life avoiding positions of authority, only to find yourself dominated by people who have no such hesitation. Or you may accumulate power compulsively, only to discover that it has become a prison, that every gain increases the paranoia of losing it.

Greene traces these dynamics to Pluto's house placement. Pluto in the seventh house, for instance, does not simply indicate "powerful partners." It describes a pattern in which you unconsciously hand your own power to the people closest to you and then experience them as controlling, manipulative, or overwhelming. The projection is invisible to you. You genuinely believe that the other person is the powerful one and you are the one being overpowered. The fated quality of this placement lies in the repetition — partner after partner turns out to be dominating — until you recognize that the power you keep giving away was yours to begin with.

Pluto in the tenth house takes the power dynamic into the public sphere. Here the compulsion may involve an obsessive relationship with career, status, or public authority — a need to achieve that has nothing to do with genuine ambition and everything to do with an unconscious terror of powerlessness. The fate of this placement often involves a public crisis, a fall from power, or a confrontation with the shadow side of authority that forces a reckoning with what power actually means and why you needed so much of it.

Greene is particularly insightful about the relationship between power and victimhood. She observes that the person who identifies as powerless is often exercising enormous unconscious power through that very identification — controlling others through guilt, manipulating through apparent helplessness, wielding moral authority from the position of the wounded. Pluto does not permit this game to continue indefinitely. Sooner or later, the transit arrives that strips away the disguise and reveals the power dynamic for what it is.

The path Greene outlines is not the acquisition of more power or the renunciation of power but a changed relationship to the entire question. Plutonian transformation involves discovering that you are neither as powerful as your fantasies of control suggest nor as helpless as your identification with victimhood insists. You occupy a middle ground that is far less dramatic than either extreme — and far more real.

### Family Fate and the Ancestral Shadow

Greene devotes considerable attention to the way fate transmits across generations within families. She argues that every family carries an unconscious inheritance — patterns of behavior, unexpressed emotions, unresolved traumas — that pass from parent to child not through genetics alone but through the invisible atmosphere of daily life. The child absorbs the parent's shadow long before it has the cognitive capacity to question what it is absorbing.

Pluto's placement by house often indicates where this ancestral material concentrates. Pluto in the fourth house, for example, suggests that the family itself is the site of the underworld — that the home environment carried an intensity, a darkness, or an unspoken power dynamic that shaped the individual's entire emotional foundation. Greene describes cases in which the family secret — the grandfather's crime, the grandmother's madness, the parent's hidden addiction — was never spoken of directly but permeated the household atmosphere, and the child grew up carrying the weight of something it could never name.

This is one of the most psychologically rich dimensions of the book. Greene shows that what feels like your personal fate may be, in part, the unfinished business of previous generations working itself out through you. The depression that descends without apparent cause, the relationship pattern that repeats despite every rational effort to change it, the obsession that seems to come from nowhere — these may be carrying the charge of ancestral material that was never metabolized by the people who originally experienced it.

The liberating implication is that becoming conscious of these patterns serves not only you but the entire family line. Greene suggests, without mystifying the idea, that when you bring awareness to the inherited shadow, you interrupt a chain of unconscious transmission. The pattern does not have to pass to your children. The fate that seemed inescapable becomes, through consciousness, a story that can be told and therefore released.

### The Paradox of Freedom Within Fate

The philosophical spine of the book is a sustained meditation on what freedom means within a fated universe. Greene refuses both poles of the standard debate. The hard determinist position — that the chart predicts fixed events and you are powerless to alter them — strikes her as psychologically deadening and empirically false, since the same chart configuration produces different life outcomes in different individuals. But the pure free-will position — that the chart merely describes tendencies you can override through conscious intention — strikes her as naive, a failure to reckon with how little of your psyche is actually under conscious control.

The position Greene arrives at is subtler and more uncomfortable than either alternative. You are free, she argues, but your freedom operates within a patterned field. The pattern is given — your natal chart, your family inheritance, the particular shape of your unconscious. Within that pattern, you have genuine choice, but the choices available to you are not unlimited. They are the choices that your particular pattern makes possible. A person with Pluto conjunct the Moon does not get to choose whether the emotional life will be intense, compulsive, and periodically devastating. That is given. What they choose is whether to meet that intensity with awareness or with denial, whether to use the depth it generates as a resource for understanding or a justification for manipulation.

Greene draws an analogy to Greek tragedy that runs through the entire book. Oedipus did not choose his fate — the oracle declared it before his birth. But at every turn, it was Oedipus's own character that drove him toward the fulfillment of that fate: his pride, his determination to know the truth, his refusal to accept limits on his own understanding. The fate and the character were not opposing forces. They were the same force, seen from two different angles. Greene reads the birth chart in exactly this way. Your Pluto placement is your oracle. Your response to it is your character. And the intersection of the two is your life.

This understanding has practical consequences for how you work with your chart. If fate and character are one, then self-knowledge is not an escape from fate but a deepening into it. You do not transcend your Pluto by understanding it. You inhabit it more fully. The suffering does not necessarily decrease, but it acquires meaning — and Greene, following Jung, treats meaningful suffering as categorically different from meaningless suffering. The person who suffers while understanding why they suffer is engaged in a process. The person who suffers without understanding is simply trapped.

## Dialogue with Jungian Psychology

Greene's relationship with Jung's work goes beyond borrowing concepts. She uses astrology to solve a problem that Jungian psychology alone cannot solve: the problem of specificity. Jung described the shadow, the anima, the collective unconscious, individuation — but these concepts are universal frameworks. They tell you that everyone has a shadow, but not where your particular shadow lives or what form it takes. The birth chart, as Greene reads it, provides exactly this information. Pluto's sign and house placement specify the domain of your shadow. Its aspects to other planets describe the internal relationships between your dark material and the rest of your personality. The transits of Pluto to natal positions describe the timing of the confrontation.

Jung's concept of synchronicity — meaningful coincidence that connects inner and outer events without causal mechanism — provides Greene with a philosophical foundation for why astrology works at all. If the inner and the outer are connected through meaning rather than causation, then the positions of planets at the moment of your birth can correspond to the patterns of your psyche without any need for physical influence. The chart is not causing your fate. It is a symbolic map of the same pattern that your life is enacting. Astrology and your lived experience are parallel expressions of a single underlying order.

Greene also extends Jung's concept of individuation — the lifelong process of integrating unconscious material into consciousness — into explicitly astrological terms. Individuation, as Greene presents it, is not a smooth process of self-improvement. It is a descent. It involves encountering precisely the material you least want to face, and the encounter is often experienced as crisis, loss, or breakdown before it is experienced as growth. Pluto transits become the astrological markers of individuation's most intense phases — the periods when the unconscious will no longer accept being ignored and forces its contents into the light through whatever means necessary.

## Reading Your Own Chart

To work with the ideas in this book, begin by locating Pluto in your natal chart. Note the sign, the house, and the aspects Pluto forms to other planets. The sign tells you the nature of the collective shadow your generation carries — the domain of experience where unconscious compulsion is strongest. The house tells you where this collective theme enters your personal life, the specific territory where you will encounter the underworld. The aspects tell you which dimensions of your personality are drawn into the Plutonian drama.

Then ask yourself where you have experienced the pattern of repetition, the return of the same crisis in different forms. Where in your life do you feel most compelled, most powerless to change, most at the mercy of forces you cannot name? That is likely the domain indicated by Pluto's house placement. Ask what you have been refusing to see in that area. What power have you been giving away? What power have you been wielding unconsciously? What would it mean to face the underworld material directly rather than continuing to meet it in projected form through external events and other people?

Pay attention to Pluto's aspects to personal planets. Pluto square the Moon, for example, suggests that the encounter with the underworld happens through the emotional life — through maternal relationships, through the body's instinctual responses, through the experience of nurturing and being nurtured. Pluto conjunct Venus places the descent in the territory of love, desire, and the compulsive dimension of attraction. Each aspect draws a different part of your personality into the Plutonian process, and Greene's sign-by-sign analysis gives you a framework for understanding how these encounters unfold.

Remember that Greene's central message is not that you can escape your fate but that you can meet it consciously. The pattern indicated by Pluto will express itself regardless. The question is whether it expresses itself through you — as a conscious participant in your own transformation — or to you, as a series of bewildering catastrophes that seem to come from nowhere.

## Limitations and Caveats

Greene's framework is powerful but not without boundaries. The book leans heavily on Greek mythology as the interpretive key to psychological experience, and while these myths are extraordinary carriers of psychological truth, they are not the only mythological tradition, and their cultural specificity inevitably shapes what the analysis can see. The dynamics Greene describes are filtered through a Western, Jungian, implicitly European lens. Readers from other cultural traditions may find that the mythological resonance does not land with the same force.

The emphasis on Pluto as the primary vehicle of fate gives the book a particular intensity that can become overwhelming. Not every life crisis is Plutonian, and not every repetitive pattern originates in the deep unconscious. Saturn, Neptune, and the lunar nodes all carry their own versions of fate, and Greene's single-minded focus on Pluto, while producing extraordinary depth, inevitably narrows the field. Her earlier Saturn book provides the necessary complement, and a reader who works with both will have a more balanced picture.

The book was written in 1984, and its clinical examples reflect the therapeutic culture of that era. Some of the case material may feel dated, and the gender dynamics in the relationship examples carry assumptions that contemporary readers will want to examine rather than absorb uncritically. Greene's psychological acuity is timeless; her social framework is not.

## Further Reading

Greene's *Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil* is the essential companion, covering the fate of limitation where this book covers the fate of transformation. Howard Sasportas's *The Gods of Change* examines Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto transits with a similarly psychological approach. For deeper grounding in the Jungian framework, James Hillman's *The Soul's Code* explores the daimon concept that animates Greene's understanding of fate. Richard Tarnas's *Cosmos and Psyche* extends the dialogue between astrology and depth psychology into the territory of world-historical cycles.

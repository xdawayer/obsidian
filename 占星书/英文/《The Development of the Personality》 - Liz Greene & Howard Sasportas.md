# The Development of the Personality — Deep Reading Notes

> This first volume in the Seminars in Psychological Astrology series, born from workshops at the Centre for Psychological Astrology in London, maps the birth chart as a blueprint of psychological growth from childhood to adulthood. Liz Greene and Howard Sasportas preserve the seminar's conversational quality, trading insights across Jungian psychology, developmental theory, and astrological symbolism in a way that neither could achieve alone. Their central argument is that the natal chart does not describe a fixed personality stamped on you at birth but rather a developmental agenda — a set of psychological tasks that unfold over a lifetime. Childhood is where the agenda is set, through the interplay of temperament and environment, and adulthood is where you either continue repeating its unfinished patterns or begin to consciously engage with them. The book makes complex psychodynamics tangible by grounding them in planetary symbolism, and it makes the birth chart come alive by treating each planet as a living voice within the psyche that demands its own form of expression.

## What This Book Illuminates

Most astrological textbooks describe the natal chart as a static portrait: you have this Moon sign, that Saturn placement, and here is what it means. Greene and Sasportas challenge this entirely. They ask not what the chart says you are but what the chart says you are in the process of becoming. The emphasis on development is not incidental — it is the book's organizing principle and its deepest contribution.

The seminars proceed through a sequence of interconnected themes: the role of childhood experience in shaping the adult personality, the way each planet functions as a distinct sub-personality within the psyche, the parental archetypes encoded in the Sun and Moon, the psychological mechanism of projection through which you encounter your own disowned qualities in other people, and the tense inner dialogues that arise when planets form hard aspects to one another. None of these themes is entirely new to psychological astrology, but Greene and Sasportas weave them together with a coherence and psychological sophistication that is rare.

What distinguishes this book within the lineage of psychological astrology is its format. The seminar dialogue preserves moments of genuine discovery — places where a participant's question leads Greene or Sasportas to articulate something they might not have reached in isolation. The text breathes. It pauses, doubles back, considers alternative interpretations. This gives it a quality of intellectual honesty that polished monographs sometimes sacrifice for elegance. You feel you are watching the ideas being thought, not just receiving conclusions. For anyone attempting to use astrology as a tool for self-understanding rather than prediction, this book provides both the theoretical scaffolding and the lived examples to make that project meaningful.

## Key Concepts

The book builds on several foundational ideas that recur across its chapters and gain depth through their interrelation.

The first is the notion of sub-personalities. Greene and Sasportas propose that each planet in your chart represents a distinct psychic entity — not merely a quality or a drive, but something closer to an autonomous character within you. The Moon is one character, with its own needs, fears, and ways of seeking comfort. Mars is another, with its own demands for assertion and its own style of anger. These inner characters do not always agree. When they form squares or oppositions in the natal chart, they represent genuinely conflicting needs within the psyche, and the resulting tension is not a problem to be solved but a dialogue to be sustained throughout life.

The second is the concept of the inner child. This is not the sentimentalized version you may encounter in popular psychology. Greene and Sasportas mean something precise: the constellation of emotional needs, defensive patterns, and unmet developmental requirements that were established in childhood and continue to operate in the adult personality, largely outside awareness. The Moon and Saturn are the primary carriers of this inner child, the Moon describing what you needed emotionally and Saturn describing what you were denied or forced to carry too soon.

Third, the book treats projection as a fundamental mechanism by which the chart operates in relationships. Whatever planetary energy you cannot own within yourself — because it was punished, because it frightens you, because it contradicts your self-image — you will reliably encounter in other people. The chart shows you precisely which energies are most likely to be projected and, therefore, which relational patterns will repeat until the projection is withdrawn.

## Deep Dive: Psychological Dynamics

### The Moon and the Archaeology of Childhood

Greene and Sasportas devote their most sustained attention to the Moon, and they approach it not as a simple descriptor of emotional style but as the psyche's memory of earliest experience. Your Moon sign and house describe the quality of nurturing you received — or, more precisely, the quality of nurturing you perceived yourself as receiving, which may differ significantly from what was objectively offered. A child with Moon in Capricorn may have experienced a mother who was physically present but emotionally reserved, reliable in practical ways but unable to offer the warmth and spontaneous affection the child also needed. A child with Moon in Pisces may have absorbed a mother's unspoken grief or confusion, taking on emotional atmospheres that did not belong to them, learning to feel for others before they had any chance to discover what they themselves felt.

The Moon, in this framework, encodes your earliest strategies for emotional survival. Whatever worked in childhood to secure the mother's attention, approval, or simply her presence becomes an automatic pattern in adulthood. If you learned that being good and quiet kept the peace, you may find yourself compulsively accommodating others decades later, unable to express anger or assert a preference without a surge of anxiety that traces directly to that early adaptation. If you learned that dramatic displays of need were the only way to penetrate a distracted parent's attention, you may carry that intensity into adult relationships, where it bewilders partners who have no idea they are interacting with a strategy designed for a very different situation.

Greene is particularly insightful on the way the Moon placement describes not just the mother's personality but the child's experience of the mothering function. The same mother can be described very differently by two children with different Moon signs, because each child filters the experience through the lens of their own lunar needs. The child with Moon in Aries needs a mother who encourages independence and tolerates anger. The child with Moon in Cancer needs a mother who provides unconditional emotional containment. When the actual mother cannot meet the specific need described by the child's Moon, a wound forms — not because the mother is bad but because the fit between the child's temperament and the available nurturing is imperfect. Much of what passes for "blaming the parents" in psychological astrology is, in Greene's handling, actually an attempt to understand the particular nature of the mismatch and why it left the specific mark it did.

Sasportas extends this into the practical territory of the Moon's house placement. The Moon in the third house shapes the emotional experience of learning and communication — you may have grown up in an environment where words were the primary currency of connection, or where the emotional climate shifted constantly like weather, requiring you to develop an almost preternatural sensitivity to nuance and implication. The Moon in the tenth house carries emotional need into the public arena — you may need to feel emotionally engaged with your work, or you may unconsciously seek a parental figure in every boss or authority, or your public reputation may be subject to the same fluctuations as your inner emotional tides.

### Saturn and the Weight of Childhood

If the Moon describes what you needed, Saturn describes what you were denied or forced to carry prematurely. Greene's treatment of Saturn in the context of personality development focuses on how limitation and frustration in childhood become internalized as a sense of inadequacy that persists long after the original conditions have changed. Saturn's sign and house tell you where in your life you expect difficulty, where you brace for disapproval, and where the voice of an internalized critical parent speaks loudest.

Saturn in the fifth house, for example, often corresponds to a childhood where creative self-expression was constrained — perhaps by a parent who valued practical achievement over play, or by circumstances that required the child to be serious before they were ready. The adult with this placement may struggle to enjoy anything without first justifying its usefulness, or they may approach creative work with a heaviness that drains the spontaneity essential to genuine creativity. The inner child in this case is the one who was told, implicitly or explicitly, that joy is a luxury and play is a waste of time.

Greene and Sasportas are particularly effective at showing how Saturn's childhood imprint creates a self-fulfilling pattern in adulthood. The person with Saturn in the seventh house who expects relationships to be burdensome and restricting approaches partnership with such guarded caution that they create exactly the dynamic they feared. The person with Saturn in the second house who carries a deep anxiety about their own worth may sabotage financial opportunities or undervalue their contributions, ensuring that the material insecurity they dread continues to characterize their experience. The chart does not cause these patterns — it describes the psychic terrain on which they unfold, and it offers, through that description, the first step toward changing them.

The seminars also explore Saturn as the father archetype, though Greene is careful to distinguish between the biographical father and the archetypal function of fathering. Your Saturn may describe your actual father's character — his coldness, his demands, his absence — but more fundamentally it describes your internalized relationship to authority, structure, and the capacity to function competently in the world. When Saturn makes hard aspects to personal planets, the father's influence tends to be felt as particularly formative, and the work of separating from the internalized father-voice — of discovering your own authority — becomes a central developmental task.

### Sub-Personalities in Conflict

One of the most original contributions of this volume is the extended exploration of what happens when planets in hard aspect represent genuinely incompatible needs within the psyche. Greene and Sasportas do not treat squares and oppositions as problems with solutions. They treat them as permanent tensions within the personality that must be held rather than resolved.

Consider a Moon-Saturn square. Here the need for emotional safety and nurturing (Moon) is in direct structural conflict with the demand for self-sufficiency and emotional control (Saturn). You cannot fully satisfy both at the same time. If you yield to the Moon's need for comfort and closeness, Saturn's voice condemns you as weak and dependent. If you follow Saturn's injunction to be strong and self-contained, the Moon's need goes underground and surfaces as depression, emotional numbness, or an inexplicable longing for something you cannot name. Greene describes people with this aspect as carrying an internal dialogue that never quite resolves — one voice saying "I need" and another responding "you should not need."

The seminars spend considerable time on Venus-Mars squares and oppositions, which Greene and Sasportas read as tensions between the desire for harmony and the desire for assertion, between the capacity for receptivity and the drive toward action. A person with Venus square Mars may find that their anger disrupts their relationships or, conversely, that their need for connection inhibits their capacity for honest self-assertion. In intimate relationships, this can manifest as a pattern of seduction and conflict, of passionate engagement followed by explosive rupture, because the two drives cannot find a stable equilibrium.

What makes their treatment of hard aspects distinctive is the insistence that these conflicts are productive. The person with a grand trine — a harmonious configuration where everything flows easily — may never develop the psychological depth that arises from inner friction. The person whose chart is full of squares and oppositions lives in a state of creative tension that, while often uncomfortable, generates the energy necessary for genuine psychological development. Greene compares this to the grain of sand in an oyster: the irritation is real, but it is also the condition for the production of something valuable. The task is not to eliminate the tension but to become conscious of it, to learn to hold both sides of the opposition rather than identifying with one and suppressing the other.

Sasportas extends this into the practical realm by describing how sub-personality conflicts manifest in daily life. The person with Mercury square Neptune, for instance, may find that their rational mind and their intuitive, imaginative capacity seem to operate on different frequencies. They sit down to write a logical report and drift into fantasy. They try to meditate and their mind produces an unstoppable stream of analysis. The conflict is between two legitimate modes of knowing, and the developmental work is to learn to honor both without letting either one dominate or suppress the other. Sasportas suggests that people with this aspect often become effective artists, writers, or therapists precisely because their work requires the integration of rational and imaginative faculties that their chart forces them to develop.

### Projection and the Repeating Relationship

The seminar's treatment of projection is among its most practically illuminating sections. Greene and Sasportas start from the Jungian premise that whatever you cannot own within yourself will be encountered outside yourself, typically in the form of other people who seem to embody the quality you have disowned. The birth chart provides a remarkably specific map of this process.

The seventh house and its contents are the primary projection screen for intimate partnerships. Planets there describe the qualities you tend to experience through others rather than expressing directly. If Uranus sits in your seventh house, you may be drawn to partners who seem excitingly unpredictable and freedom-loving, only to find yourself repeatedly destabilized by their refusal to settle down — not recognizing that the urge for independence and disruption actually belongs to your own unacknowledged Uranus. If Pluto occupies the seventh, you may encounter partners who seem controlling or psychologically intense, and the power struggles that ensue are partly a mirror of your own unintegrated relationship to power and transformation.

Greene describes the typical arc of a projected relationship with clinical precision. First, you meet someone who carries the energy you have disowned, and you are fascinated — they possess something vital that you lack. Then, as the initial enchantment fades, you begin to resent the very quality that drew you. The Uranus person's spontaneity becomes irresponsibility. The Pluto person's depth becomes manipulation. What you are actually resenting is the pressure of your own unlived potential, which the other person's presence makes impossible to ignore. The relationship either breaks down at this point, and you move on to find another person who carries the same projection, or it becomes the occasion for genuine self-discovery — you begin to recognize that the quality you loved and hated in the other person was your own all along.

Sasportas adds the observation that projection operates not only in romantic relationships but in every significant relational context. Your boss may carry your Saturn projection, appearing as the critical authority you both seek and resent. Your best friend may carry your Jupiter, embodying the optimism and expansiveness you have exiled from your own self-concept. Your child may carry the projection of an unlived planet in your fifth house, and you may unconsciously pressure them to live out the creative or expressive potential you never claimed for yourself.

The seminar participants raise particularly sharp questions about whether projection can ever be fully withdrawn. Greene's response is nuanced: complete withdrawal of projections may be a theoretical ideal rather than a practical achievement. What you can do is become progressively more aware of the mechanism, so that when you find yourself intensely attracted to or repelled by a quality in another person, you develop the habit of asking whether that quality has a home somewhere in your own chart. This practice does not eliminate the projection, but it loosens its grip, creating a space between the automatic reaction and a more conscious response.

### The 4th and 10th Houses: Family as Psychological Theater

The seminars devote sustained attention to the 4th and 10th houses as the axis along which family dynamics are inscribed in the chart. The 4th house, traditionally associated with the home, the family of origin, and the more private parent, functions in this framework as the repository of your deepest emotional conditioning — the patterns absorbed before you had any language for them, the atmospheric quality of the household in which your psyche first took shape. The 10th house, associated with the public parent, authority, and social role, carries the imprint of the parent who modeled how to operate in the world beyond the family.

Greene explores how the sign on the 4th house cusp and any planets within it describe the emotional texture of the family environment you internalized. Pluto in the 4th house, for instance, suggests a family atmosphere charged with unspoken intensity — power dynamics operating beneath the surface, secrets held tightly, the sense that something profound and potentially dangerous lay just below the calm of everyday domestic life. The child raised in this atmosphere absorbs not just the specific family dynamics but the general proposition that emotional life is a territory of hidden forces, and they may carry this into adulthood as a simultaneous fear of and fascination with psychological depth.

Sasportas addresses the 10th house as the place where the parent-child relationship transforms into the individual's relationship with the wider social world. The internalized authority of the 10th-house parent becomes the template for how you relate to bosses, institutions, and your own ambitions. If Saturn occupies your 10th house, you may approach public life with a gravity and a fear of failure that traces directly to a parent who embodied those qualities. If Jupiter sits there, you may have internalized a parent who was expansive, confident, perhaps overreaching, and you carry that tone into your own professional life — for better and for worse.

The seminar discussions bring out how the 4th-10th axis often tells a story of compensation. The person whose 4th house describes emotional deprivation may pour compensatory energy into 10th-house achievement, building a public life that functions as a substitute for the private belonging they never had. Conversely, the person whose 10th house carries a heavy Saturn may retreat into the 4th house, preferring the safety of private life to the vulnerability of public exposure. Greene and Sasportas suggest that the developmental task is not to choose one end of the axis over the other but to build a life in which inner emotional reality and outer social engagement are in genuine conversation with each other — where what you do in the world grows from who you are in your depths.

## Dialogue with Jungian Psychology

The entire framework of this book is Jungian in its bones, but Greene and Sasportas do more than borrow Jung's terminology — they demonstrate that astrological symbolism gives Jungian concepts a precision they otherwise lack.

Jung's theory of complexes proposes that the psyche contains clusters of emotionally charged material organized around archetypal cores. The mother complex, for instance, is the constellation of feelings, memories, and behavioral patterns that crystallized around your experience of the maternal. Greene and Sasportas show that the natal chart describes the specific structure of each individual's complexes with a specificity that Jungian theory alone cannot provide. The Moon in Scorpio in the 8th house describes a very different mother complex than the Moon in Gemini in the 3rd house — not just different in degree but different in kind, producing different defensive strategies, different relational patterns, different paths toward integration.

The concept of individuation — Jung's term for the lifelong process of becoming a conscious, integrated self — runs through the book as an implicit organizing principle. Each chapter, whether it addresses the inner child, sub-personality conflicts, or projection, is ultimately about a specific dimension of the individuation process. The withdrawal of projections is individuation in the relational sphere. The integration of conflicting sub-personalities is individuation within the psyche. The conscious engagement with childhood patterns is individuation at its root.

What the astrological framework adds to Jung is a developmental timetable. Through transits and progressions — which the book touches on though they are not its primary focus — the individuation process acquires specific timing. Saturn's return at twenty-nine initiates one kind of reckoning, Uranus's opposition to its natal position at forty-two initiates another. The birth chart is not merely a map of what needs to be integrated — it is a map of when the psyche is most likely to demand that integration occur.

## Reading Your Own Chart

Begin with the Moon. Locate its sign and house and sit with the question: what did I need most as a child, and how did I learn to get it? The sign describes the quality of nurturing that felt essential — warmth, stimulation, independence, order — and the house describes the area of life where that need was most acute. Then consider whether the strategies you developed to meet that need in childhood are still operating automatically in your adult life.

Next, find Saturn. Note where it falls by sign and house and ask: where do I feel most inadequate, most defended? Where do I expect criticism or failure? Then look at whether Saturn makes hard aspects to any personal planets — Moon, Sun, Venus, Mars, Mercury — because those aspects describe specific inner conflicts between the need for growth and the fear of inadequacy.

Look at your 7th house. Whatever planets reside there, or the sign on the cusp if the house is empty, describes what you are most likely to project onto intimate partners. If you find yourself repeatedly drawn to the same type of person, or repeatedly frustrated by the same quality in different partners, the 7th house will often explain the pattern.

Finally, examine any squares and oppositions between planets. These are not flaws in your chart. They are the creative tensions that, if you can learn to hold them consciously rather than acting them out blindly, become the source of your most genuine psychological depth. When you feel torn between two irreconcilable impulses, the chart is showing you the specific nature of the conflict and, by extension, the specific form that integration might take.

## Limitations and Caveats

The book's strength — its Jungian depth — is also its boundary. Readers unfamiliar with basic Jungian concepts may find certain passages opaque, and the framework assumes that the primary purpose of astrology is psychological self-understanding rather than the prediction of events. Traditional astrologers seeking concrete predictive techniques will not find them here. The approach also tends toward a therapeutic sensibility that, while humane and insightful, may undervalue the predictive and divinatory dimensions of astrology that other traditions consider central.

The seminar format, while preserving a valuable sense of intellectual immediacy, also means the book lacks the systematic organization of a textbook. Ideas are introduced, dropped, and returned to in a pattern that mirrors live conversation rather than linear argument. Some readers will find this stimulating; others will wish for clearer signposting.

The cultural context is also worth noting. The book emerged from a specifically European, late-twentieth-century, middle-class therapeutic milieu. Its assumptions about family structure, parental roles, and the nature of psychological development are shaped by that context and may not translate straightforwardly to all readers. Families organized around collective rather than nuclear models, or cultures where the individual psyche is not the primary unit of analysis, will require adaptation of the framework rather than direct application.

## Further Reading

Howard Sasportas's *The Twelve Houses* provides a fuller treatment of the psychological meaning of each house, deepening the 4th-10th axis discussion that receives concentrated attention in this volume. Liz Greene's *Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil* remains the essential companion for understanding Saturn's developmental role in the chart — its analysis of Saturn by sign, house, and aspect provides the detailed foundation that the seminar discussions presuppose. The second volume in this seminar series, *The Luminaries*, extends the analysis of the Sun and Moon as parental archetypes and the process of ego formation, and deserves to be read as a direct continuation of the themes explored here.

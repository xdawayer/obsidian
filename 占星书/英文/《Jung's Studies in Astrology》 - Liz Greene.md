# Jung's Studies in Astrology — Deep Reading Notes

> Liz Greene's Jung's Studies in Astrology: Prophecy, Magic, and the Qualities of Time (2018) is a work of meticulous historical scholarship that does something no previous book has accomplished: it reconstructs the full scope of Carl Jung's engagement with astrology, drawing not only on his published Collected Works and letters but on unpublished manuscripts, private correspondence, and archival documents that had never previously seen the light of day. Based on Greene's doctoral research, the book does not argue that Jung was secretly an astrologer or that Jungian psychology validates astrology. It does something more rigorous and more unsettling. It demonstrates that astrology was not a marginal curiosity for Jung but a structuring concern that shaped his theories of archetypes, synchronicity, the nature of time, and the process of individuation. Greene then subjects the entire tradition of "Jungian astrology" to the same exacting scrutiny, asking which of its claims are actually supported by what Jung wrote and which are wishful misreadings. The result is a book that serves both Jungian scholars and serious astrologers by complicating the comfortable story each group has told itself.

## The Question at Stake

The question at the center of this book is deceptively simple: what did Jung actually think about astrology, and why does it matter? The difficulty is that Jung himself made this question nearly impossible to answer straightforwardly. He discussed astrology in virtually every volume of the Collected Works, referenced it extensively in his letters, used birth charts in clinical practice with his patients, and devoted a substantial section of his 1952 essay on synchronicity to an astrological experiment. Yet he was also evasive, contradictory, and strategically cautious in his public pronouncements, aware that too open an embrace of astrology would jeopardize the scientific credibility he fought to establish for analytical psychology.

Greene's question, then, is not merely biographical. It is epistemological. If one of the twentieth century's most influential psychologists found astrology indispensable to his theoretical work, what does that tell you about the nature of astrological knowledge? Astrology occupies an awkward position in modern intellectual life: it does not meet the criteria of empirical science, yet it persists as a living practice that practitioners report finding effective in clinical and consulting contexts. Jung sat precisely at this fault line, drawn to astrology's symbolic richness while unable — or unwilling — to locate it within any single epistemological framework. He tried causality and rejected it. He tried statistical validation and found the results inconclusive. He developed the concept of synchronicity partly to provide a framework for phenomena like astrological correlation, and even then remained ambivalent about whether he had solved the problem.

The book builds upon the work of Jungian historians like Sonu Shamdasani, who contributed its foreword, while challenging the casual assumptions of astrologers who have invoked Jung's name for decades without examining what he actually said. The stakes are real: if the relationship between Jung and astrology is more complicated than either his defenders or his critics have acknowledged, then both Jungian psychology and astrological practice need to reckon with that complexity.

## The Arc of the Argument

Greene's argument unfolds as an intellectual excavation. She begins not with Jung's conclusions but with his sources — the specific astrologers he studied, the particular textbooks he read, the individuals who taught him chart interpretation. This is a deliberate choice. By reconstructing what Jung knew about astrology and where he learned it, Greene prevents you from projecting contemporary astrological knowledge backward onto Jung's understanding.

From this foundation, she maps Jung's evolving interpretation of astrology across the span of his career. The early period, reflected in correspondence with Freud, shows Jung already fascinated by the correlations he observed between birth charts and personality structures. The middle period sees him developing the theoretical apparatus — archetypes, the collective unconscious, the four psychological functions mapped onto the four elements — that would become the infrastructure of psychological astrology, though Jung himself never used that term. The synchronicity essay of 1952 represents a turning point: Jung's attempt to provide a principled account of how astrology might work without recourse to causal mechanisms. And the late work, particularly Aion with its elaborate analysis of the precession of the equinoxes and the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, reveals a Jung for whom astrology had become inseparable from his understanding of historical and psychological transformation.

Throughout this arc, Greene maintains a critical distance that distinguishes her work from the hagiographic tendencies of much writing on Jung and astrology. She shows where Jung's reasoning was brilliant and where it was confused, where his astrological knowledge was sophisticated and where it was limited by the sources available to him. The conclusion is not a verdict but a clarification: Jung's astrology was real, extensive, and consequential for his theoretical work, but it was also idiosyncratic, unfinished, and marked by the same tensions that pervade his psychology as a whole.

## Deep Dive: Core Arguments

### The Private Astrologer: Jung's Concealed Practice

One of the most consequential arguments in the book is Greene's demonstration that Jung's engagement with astrology was far more extensive in private than his published works suggest. Through examination of his private archives, unpublished letters, and the records of those who worked closely with him, Greene establishes that Jung regularly cast and consulted birth charts for his patients as part of the analytic process. He did not merely find astrology interesting in the abstract. He used it as a diagnostic and interpretive tool, examining planetary placements and transits to understand the timing and character of psychological crises in the people he treated.

This matters because the public Jung — the Jung of the Collected Works — treated astrology with a calculated ambiguity. He would acknowledge its "remarkable" correlations in one passage and then qualify his statements with disclaimers about lacking a causal explanation in the next. Greene argues that this ambiguity was strategic rather than genuine. Jung understood that his position in the intellectual world was precarious. He had already endured the rupture with Freud and the charge of mysticism from the psychoanalytic establishment. To openly advocate for astrology would have provided his critics with exactly the ammunition they needed to dismiss analytical psychology as occultism. So he practiced a kind of intellectual double bookkeeping: using astrology clinically while keeping a safe public distance from it.

Greene traces this pattern through Jung's correspondence with particular care. In letters to individuals he trusted — fellow practitioners, students, astrologers — Jung was remarkably candid about his reliance on birth charts. He described specific chart configurations and their psychological correlates with a fluency that reveals sustained practice, not casual dabbling. The gap between the private and public Jung on this subject is one of the book's most important findings, because it means that the standard scholarly account of Jung's relationship with astrology — based solely on the Collected Works — is incomplete in ways that distort the picture fundamentally.

What makes Greene's handling of this material trustworthy is her refusal to treat the private evidence as a simple corrective that reveals the "real" Jung. She acknowledges that people say different things in different contexts for complex reasons, and that the private letters carry their own rhetorical purposes. The point is not that the private Jung was the authentic one and the public Jung was a fraud, but that the full picture requires both, and that the full picture is considerably more interesting than either version alone.

Greene also reconstructs the specific context in which Jung learned astrology. His early correspondence with Freud already shows him grappling with occult and astrological themes, and the rupture between the two men was connected, at least in part, to their differing attitudes toward such material. Freud regarded the occult with deep suspicion; Jung could not leave it alone. As the break with Freud liberated Jung to pursue his own intellectual interests without the constraints of psychoanalytic orthodoxy, astrology moved from the periphery of his attention toward its center. Greene documents how this trajectory shaped not just Jung's personal development but the theoretical architecture of analytical psychology itself. The timing matters: the period of Jung's most intense engagement with astrology coincided with the period in which he developed many of his most original ideas, suggesting that astrological thinking was not a supplement to his psychology but an integral part of its formation.

### Synchronicity and the Astrological Experiment

The second major argument addresses the role astrology played in Jung's development of the synchronicity concept, and it is here that Greene's analysis becomes most technically precise. Jung's 1952 essay "Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle" is one of the most discussed — and most misunderstood — texts in his entire oeuvre. The essay contains a lengthy section in which Jung reports the results of an astrological experiment: a statistical analysis of the birth charts of married couples, designed to test whether traditional astrological indicators of compatibility (such as Sun-Moon conjunctions between partners) appeared more frequently than chance would predict.

Greene reconstructs the experiment with the attention to detail it deserves. Jung collected 483 pairs of marriage horoscopes, analyzed in three batches, looking for the traditional astrological markers of relational bonding. The results were, by conventional statistical standards, inconclusive. Certain expected configurations — particularly the woman's Moon in conjunction with the man's Sun — appeared with suggestive frequency in individual batches, but the overall results did not achieve statistical significance. A strict empiricist would have concluded that the experiment failed to support astrological claims.

But Jung drew a different conclusion, and Greene's analysis of that conclusion is one of the most illuminating sections of the book. Jung argued that the process of the experiment itself — the way suggestive results appeared and disappeared across batches, the way the experimenter's expectations seemed to influence which batch yielded the most striking findings — was itself an instance of synchronicity. The meaning was not in the statistical outcome but in the meaningful coincidence between the researcher's psychological state and the pattern of results. The experiment, in Jung's reading, did not prove astrology through statistics. It demonstrated synchronicity through the failure of statistics to capture what was actually happening.

Greene is scrupulous in acknowledging the circularity risk in this reasoning. If a failed experiment is reinterpreted as evidence for the very principle it was supposed to test, you have a framework that cannot be falsified, and unfalsifiability is a serious philosophical problem. She notes that Jung was aware of this difficulty but never fully resolved it. His solution was to gesture toward a mode of knowing that transcends the subject-object split of conventional science — a mode in which the observer and the observed are entangled in ways that statistical methods cannot capture. Whether you find this compelling or evasive depends heavily on your epistemological commitments, and Greene does not try to make the decision for you. What she does is show you exactly what Jung claimed, exactly what the evidence supports, and exactly where the argument becomes speculative.

This section also reveals something important about the relationship between synchronicity and astrology more broadly. Many astrologers have adopted synchronicity as a ready-made explanation for how astrology works — "it's synchronicity" has become almost a reflex answer in astrological circles. Greene demonstrates that this casual adoption misrepresents Jung's concept. Synchronicity, for Jung, was not a mechanism. It was a description of a class of phenomena — meaningful coincidences with no causal connection — and he was never confident that he had explained those phenomena. He had named them. Naming is not explaining. When astrologers invoke synchronicity as though it settles the question of astrology's epistemological status, they are doing precisely what Greene suggests Jung tried to avoid: converting an honest perplexity into a premature certainty.

Greene further illuminates the historical context of the experiment by showing that Jung undertook it at a moment when he was under pressure from his collaborator, the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, to provide some empirical grounding for the synchronicity concept. Pauli was sympathetic to Jung's ideas but insisted that they needed to make contact with observable phenomena if they were to be taken seriously. The astrological experiment was, in part, Jung's response to this challenge — an attempt to find a domain where synchronicity could be observed and, ideally, measured. The fact that the experiment produced ambiguous results did not, in Greene's reading, represent a failure of astrology so much as a demonstration that the phenomenon under investigation resisted the very methods being applied to it. This is a philosophically interesting position, but Greene is honest about its risks: if you define your phenomenon as one that escapes conventional measurement, you have effectively insulated it from empirical challenge, and that insulation carries a cost in intellectual credibility that cannot be wished away.

### Archetypes, Planets, and the Problem of Projection

The third major argument concerns the structural relationship between Jung's theory of archetypes and the traditional astrological symbol system. Greene traces how Jung came to view the planets as what might be called external projections of archetypal contents — the gods of the solar system as mirrors of psychic structures that exist in the collective unconscious. This idea has become so commonplace in psychological astrology that it is easy to forget how radical it was when Jung first articulated it, and how many complications it contains.

Jung's position, as Greene reconstructs it, held that the planets do not cause psychological states. Rather, the human psyche, encountering the visible planets in the sky, projected its own archetypal contents onto them, creating the elaborate system of correspondences that constitutes astrological tradition. Saturn does not make you depressed; rather, the archetype that Saturn symbolizes — the principle of limitation, time, structure, and the encounter with mortality — is a permanent feature of the collective unconscious that found its mythological expression in the figure of Kronos-Saturn and its astrological expression in the planet's chart placement.

Greene identifies the conceptual power in this move: it preserves the psychological reality of astrological symbolism while avoiding the causal claims that modern science finds indefensible. If planets are symbols of archetypes, then astrology is a symbolic language for mapping psychic life, not a set of causal hypotheses about celestial influence. This is the theoretical foundation on which an entire generation of psychological astrologers built their practice, and many of them credited Jung directly.

But Greene also identifies the problem embedded in this framework, and it is a problem that most Jungian astrologers have ignored. If the relationship between planets and archetypes is purely projective — if the psyche imposes meaning on an inherently meaningless cosmos — then there is no reason to expect that planetary positions should correlate with anything at all. Projection, in the strict Jungian sense, is a subjective process. It tells you about the projector, not about the object onto which the projection falls. If you project your father complex onto your boss, that tells you something about your psyche, but it tells you nothing about your boss. Similarly, if the archetype of Saturn is projected onto the planet Saturn, that tells you something about the collective unconscious, but it does not explain why Saturn's position at the moment of birth should correspond to specific psychological traits.

Jung was aware of this difficulty, and Greene tracks his attempts to navigate it. At times, he seemed to lean toward a genuinely participatory cosmos — one in which the relationship between inner and outer is not projection but correspondence, a real structural alignment between psyche and world. This is where the concept of synchronicity enters: not as a mechanism, but as a principle holding that meaningful patterns can manifest simultaneously in inner and outer domains without one causing the other. At other times, Jung retreated to safer ground, treating astrology as a useful symbolic tool without committing to any ontological claim about the cosmos. Greene argues that this oscillation is not a flaw in Jung's thinking that can be resolved by choosing one side. It reflects a genuine philosophical dilemma that remains unresolved in both Jungian psychology and astrological theory.

The practical consequences of this dilemma are significant. If you adopt the pure projection model, you gain psychological respectability — you are talking about the psyche, not making unverifiable claims about the cosmos — but you lose any reason to think that the actual positions of the actual planets at the actual moment of birth should matter. The chart becomes a Rorschach inkblot: useful for eliciting psychological material, but no more inherently meaningful than any other random stimulus. If, on the other hand, you adopt a participatory model in which psyche and cosmos genuinely correspond, you preserve astrology's core claim that planetary positions carry meaning, but you commit yourself to a cosmology that the modern world has largely abandoned. Greene shows that Jung oscillated between these positions because both have genuine strengths and neither can be maintained without cost, and she argues that the honest response is to hold the tension rather than resolve it prematurely in either direction.

### The Anima Mundi and the Qualities of Time

The fourth argument moves into the philosophical and historical territory that gives the book its subtitle. Greene traces the tradition of the anima mundi — the world soul — from its origins in Plato's Timaeus through Neoplatonism, the Hermetic tradition, Renaissance natural philosophy, and into its modern echoes in Romantic thought and depth psychology. This is not intellectual decoration. It is the conceptual thread that Greene identifies as offering the most coherent alternative framework for understanding how astrology might function.

The anima mundi tradition holds that the cosmos is not dead matter but a living, ensouled whole in which every part participates in the life of every other part. In this framework, the relationship between planets and human experience is neither causal (the planets do not push you around) nor merely projective (you are not just imagining patterns in the sky). It is participatory: both the planet and the psyche are expressions of the same underlying living reality, and their correspondence reflects a shared participation in the world soul. The planets do not influence you because they are you, in the sense that both you and they are manifestations of the same animate cosmos.

Greene demonstrates that Jung drew extensively on this tradition, though he rarely used the term anima mundi directly. His concept of the collective unconscious, she argues, is structurally parallel to the anima mundi in ways that Jung himself recognized. The collective unconscious is not located in individual brains. It is a transpersonal psychic field that manifests through individual psyches but is not reducible to them. Similarly, the anima mundi is not located in any particular part of the cosmos but animates the whole. When Jung wrote that "the idea of the anima mundi coincides with that of the collective unconscious," he was making explicit a connection that runs beneath the surface of much of his work.

This leads to what Greene identifies as Jung's most philosophically daring contribution to astrological theory: the concept of the qualities of time. For Jung, time is not merely a neutral container in which events occur. Each moment has a qualitative character — a specific archetypal signature — that is reflected in the planetary configuration at that moment. The birth chart, in this understanding, does not record a set of celestial causes acting on the newborn. It records the qualitative character of the moment itself, the particular archetypal pattern that was constellated at the time of birth. "Time is often the symbol of fate," Jung declared, and in this formulation, astrology becomes the art of reading the qualities of time.

Greene traces how this idea relates to the ancient concept of katarche — the idea that the quality of the beginning of any venture permeates its entire unfolding. If you begin a marriage, a business, or a life at a moment with a particular archetypal character, that character will express itself throughout the duration of what was begun. This is not causation. It is participation: the event and the moment share the same quality because they are both expressions of the same underlying reality. Greene argues that this framework, while foreign to the modern scientific mind, is actually more internally consistent than either the causal model (planets affect people) or the projection model (people imagine patterns in planets) and that Jung grasped this, even if he could never quite bring himself to state it with full conviction.

What makes Greene's treatment of the anima mundi especially valuable is her refusal to romanticize it. She acknowledges that the tradition carries its own intellectual baggage — Neoplatonic metaphysics, Hermetic correspondences, assumptions about the hierarchical structure of reality that sit uneasily with modern sensibilities. She does not ask you to adopt the anima mundi framework wholesale. She asks you to recognize it as a coherent intellectual tradition that provides resources for thinking about astrology's mechanism problem that neither empirical science nor pure psychology can offer. The tradition survived the Enlightenment's assault on enchanted cosmologies not because people were too superstitious to let it go, but because it addressed something in human experience that the mechanistic worldview could not account for: the persistent sense that the cosmos is not indifferent, that there is a correspondence between inner and outer that transcends mere coincidence. Whether this sense reflects reality or illusion is precisely the question the book leaves open, and Greene's achievement is to show that it is a question worth taking seriously rather than dismissing out of hand.

### The Critical Examination of "Jungian Astrology"

The fifth argument is perhaps the most surprising, given that Greene herself is often regarded as a founding figure of psychological astrology. She turns her scholarly apparatus on the tradition that bears Jung's name in astrological circles and subjects it to the same rigorous examination she applied to Jung's own writings. The results are uncomfortable for practitioners who have built their work on the assumption that Jung endorsed what they do.

Greene demonstrates that many of the ideas commonly attributed to Jung by astrologers are, in fact, distortions, oversimplifications, or outright misreadings of his actual positions. The reduction of the twelve zodiac signs to twelve Jungian archetypes, for instance, is a mapping that Jung never made and that misunderstands his concept of archetypes, which are not fixed types but dynamic, formless potentials that manifest differently in different contexts. The claim that Jung "proved" astrology through his synchronicity research mistakes an inconclusive experiment for a validation. The use of Jungian terminology — shadow, anima, individuation — as a decorative vocabulary applied to traditional chart interpretation, without engaging the depth and difficulty of what those concepts actually mean in Jung's psychology, represents a superficial borrowing rather than a genuine integration.

Greene also examines the specific astrologers who influenced Jung and whom Jung in turn influenced, tracing a web of personal relationships and intellectual exchanges that complicates the simple narrative of Jung as the father of psychological astrology. She discusses the Theosophical astrologer Alan Leo, whose "modern" astrology of character rather than event influenced Jung's thinking. She examines Max Heindel's Rosicrucian astrology and the less well-known figure of John Thorburn, who introduced Jung to the concept of "epoch" charts. Through these biographical investigations, Greene shows that Jung's astrology was shaped by specific, historically situated individuals and traditions, not drawn from some universal well of astrological wisdom.

The implication is not that Jungian astrology is fraudulent but that it needs to be rebuilt on more honest foundations. If you are going to invoke Jung, Greene insists, you should know what he actually said, where he was uncertain, and what he never claimed. This is a call for intellectual integrity that applies to both the astrological and the Jungian communities.

### The Aion and the Great Ages

The sixth argument addresses Jung's late work Aion (1951), in which he devoted sustained attention to the astrological ages — the roughly two-thousand-year periods defined by the precession of the equinoxes — and specifically to the transition from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. Greene demonstrates that this was not a late-career eccentricity but the culmination of a lifelong preoccupation. Jung saw the astrological ages as the largest-scale expression of archetypal patterns in human history, and he interpreted the Piscean age as the era of Christianity, with its characteristic split between spirit and matter, light and shadow, Christ and Antichrist.

Greene's analysis reveals that Jung treated the symbolism of the fish — the traditional sign of Pisces and of Christ — as an archetypal pattern that shaped two millennia of Western civilization. The dawn of the Aquarian age, in Jung's reading, would bring a fundamentally different archetypal signature: the Water Bearer, the figure who distributes rather than hoards, who decentralizes rather than centralizes, who integrates opposites rather than splitting them. Jung was cautious about prediction, but he was clearly persuaded that the precessional cycle described real patterns of collective psychological transformation.

Greene situates this within the broader intellectual context of Jung's work, showing how Aion attempted to provide a rational, psychological exegesis of the visionary material that had poured through Jung during the period documented in the Red Book. The astrological ages were, for Jung, the largest canvas on which archetypal patterns painted themselves, and astrology was the interpretive system that made those patterns legible. Greene argues that you cannot fully understand Aion — or Jung's late thought more generally — without understanding the astrological framework that structures it, a framework that most Jungian scholars have either ignored or minimized.

This argument has implications that extend beyond Jung scholarship. If Greene is correct that the astrological ages provided Jung with his primary framework for understanding collective psychological transformation, then the tendency of Jungian scholars to treat Aion as a difficult or eccentric late work is not merely an oversight but a systematic misreading. The book becomes strange and opaque when you remove its astrological scaffolding, because that scaffolding is not decoration but structure. Greene's reading restores the intelligibility of a text that has baffled many of Jung's own interpreters, and it does so by taking seriously what those interpreters preferred to look away from. The broader point is that the deliberate minimization of astrology in Jungian scholarship has not merely left a gap in the historical record. It has actively distorted the interpretation of works that cannot be understood without their astrological dimension.

## Intellectual Coordinates

Greene's book occupies a unique position at the intersection of several intellectual traditions. It is, first and foremost, a work of Jungian historiography in the tradition established by Sonu Shamdasani, who has done more than any other scholar to reconstruct what Jung actually thought and did, as opposed to what his followers wished he had thought and done. Greene applies Shamdasani's exacting standards of archival research to a topic — astrology — that most Jungian historians have avoided, either because they considered it embarrassing or because they lacked the astrological knowledge to evaluate it.

Within the history of astrology, the book challenges the narrative that psychological astrology represents a straightforward evolution from Jung's ideas. Greene shows that the relationship is far more tangled, mediated by specific individuals and intellectual currents that the standard story omits. This places her work alongside revisionist histories by scholars like Nicholas Campion and Patrick Curry, who have sought to understand astrology's place in intellectual history without either condemning or celebrating it.

Within the philosophy of science, the book engages — though it does not fully resolve — the epistemological questions raised by Thomas Kuhn's work on paradigm shifts and the broader debate about the boundaries of legitimate knowledge. Greene does not claim that astrology is a science, but she demonstrates that its dismissal by the scientific establishment rests on philosophical assumptions rather than empirical evidence. This aligns her work with the tradition of thinkers who have questioned whether the mechanistic worldview is adequate to the full range of human experience.

The book was recognized with the International Association for Jungian Studies award for best authored book in 2018, signaling its acceptance within the scholarly Jungian community — a community that has historically been uncomfortable with astrology's presence in Jung's legacy. That acceptance itself marks a shift in intellectual climate. Twenty years earlier, a scholarly monograph on Jung's astrology published by a major academic press and endorsed by Sonu Shamdasani would have been difficult to imagine. Greene's work arrived at a moment when the publication of the Red Book in 2009 had already forced Jungian scholars to confront aspects of Jung's inner life — his visionary experiences, his engagement with occult traditions, his practice of active imagination — that had previously been kept at arm's length. The book's reception suggests that the Jungian community may finally be ready to integrate its own shadow material regarding astrology, though the broader academic world remains largely unaware of the conversation.

## Implications for Practice

If you take Greene's arguments seriously, they change how you practice astrology in several concrete ways. First, you become more cautious about invoking Jung. Instead of treating "Jungian astrology" as a settled framework, you recognize it as an ongoing project with unresolved tensions at its core. You stop using synchronicity as a magic word that explains how astrology works and start treating it as an honest description of a phenomenon that resists easy explanation.

Second, your relationship to the astrological symbol system deepens. If planets are not causes but participants in an ensouled cosmos, then reading a chart is not decoding a mechanism but entering into a relationship with living symbols. The quality of your attention matters. The interpretive act is not neutral observation but participation in the same field of meaning that the chart describes.

Third, you gain a more nuanced understanding of why astrology occupies the uncomfortable position it does in modern intellectual life. It is not simply that science has not yet caught up with astrology, nor that astrology is a relic of prescientific thinking. The problem is deeper: astrology presupposes a kind of cosmos that the dominant Western worldview does not recognize, and no amount of statistical research will resolve the question as long as the underlying cosmological assumptions remain unexamined. Greene's work pushes you to examine those assumptions rather than hoping that the next study will finally prove the skeptics wrong.

Fourth, the book gives you permission to hold uncertainty. Jung himself never arrived at a tidy conclusion about how or why astrology works, and Greene suggests that this uncertainty is not a failure but an appropriate response to a genuine mystery. In practical terms, this means you can work with a birth chart seriously and skillfully without needing to answer the question of why it works before you sit down with a client. The practitioner who is comfortable with not knowing is often a more honest and more effective reader than the one who has adopted a theoretical framework — whether Jungian, Theosophical, or scientific — that provides false certainty about the nature of astrological correspondence.

## Gaps and Vulnerabilities

The most significant vulnerability in Greene's argument lies in its dependence on archival material that is not fully accessible to other scholars. While the private letters and unpublished documents she cites are real and verifiable in principle, the Jung family archives have historically been difficult for independent researchers to access. This means that certain key claims — particularly about the extent of Jung's private astrological practice — rest on evidence that not every reader can independently confirm.

A second gap is the book's limited engagement with critiques of Jung's methodology from outside the Jungian tradition. Cognitive psychologists and philosophers of science have raised serious objections to concepts like synchronicity and the collective unconscious — objections that do not merely dismiss these ideas but engage them on substantive grounds. Greene acknowledges these critiques in passing but does not give them the sustained attention they deserve, which leaves her defense of Jung's astrological framework somewhat one-sided.

Third, the book's focus on Western astrology means that the extensive astrological traditions of India, China, and the Islamic world remain outside its scope. Since Jung drew on a specifically Western symbolic vocabulary, this limitation is understandable, but it means that larger questions about whether the archetypal framework applies universally remain unaddressed.

Finally, Greene's critical examination of Jungian astrology, while rigorous, may understate the pragmatic value of imperfect frameworks. Astrologers who have used Jungian concepts loosely but effectively in clinical work may find that Greene's scholarly corrections, however accurate, do not fully account for what made those concepts useful in practice.

## Further Reading

The companion volume, The Astrological World of Jung's Liber Novus (2018), extends Greene's analysis into the visionary text that Jung considered his most important work. Sonu Shamdasani's Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology provides essential context for understanding the intellectual landscape in which Jung operated. Richard Tarnas's Cosmos and Psyche offers the most ambitious contemporary argument for archetypal cosmology, building on Jungian foundations that Greene's work helps you evaluate more critically. For Jung's own astrological writings collected in one place, see Jung on Astrology, edited by Safron Rossi and Keiron Le Grice. Maggie Hyde's Jung and Astrology provides a shorter, more accessible treatment of similar territory, though with a different critical emphasis.

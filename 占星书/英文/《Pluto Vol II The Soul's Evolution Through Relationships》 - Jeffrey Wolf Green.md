# Pluto, Volume II: The Soul's Evolution Through Relationships — Deep Reading Notes

> Jeffrey Wolf Green's *Pluto, Volume II: The Soul's Evolution Through Relationships*, published in 1997, takes the evolutionary framework established in Volume I and turns it toward the arena where soul growth is most acutely felt: intimate relationship. If the first volume mapped the soul's evolutionary intent through Pluto's natal position, the polarity point, and the nodal axis, this second volume asks what happens when two such evolutionary blueprints collide. The result is a dense, uncompromising treatise on why you meet the people you meet, why certain relationships carry a weight that defies rational explanation, and why the patterns you repeat in love are not accidents of personality but expressions of the soul's unfinished work across lifetimes. Green extends his interpretive system into synastry, composite charts, Venus and Mars as soul-level indicators of desire and value, and the evolutionary stages of relationship itself — from dependence through independence to genuine interdependence. The book is not easy reading. It asks you to hold the entire structure of Volume I in mind while adding new dimensions of relational complexity. But for the reader willing to sustain the effort, it offers a framework for understanding relationship that goes far deeper than compatibility and far beyond a single lifetime.

## The Soul's Question

The question this book addresses is not whether your relationships will succeed or fail but what your soul is trying to learn through the experience of relating to another human being. Green begins from the premise that no significant relationship is accidental. Every person who enters your life with sufficient emotional charge to alter your trajectory — every lover, every partner who devastates you, every connection that feels fated — is there because the soul required that specific encounter at that specific moment in its evolutionary journey. The meeting is not random. It is purposeful, even when the purpose remains invisible to the conscious mind.

The deeper question the book pursues is this: how does the soul evolve through the experience of intimacy, and why does that evolution so often require pain? Green argues that relationships are the most powerful catalyst for soul growth precisely because they expose everything you have been hiding from yourself. In isolation, you can maintain your defenses indefinitely. You can construct an identity that accommodates your unexamined compulsions and call it your personality. But the moment another person gets close enough to truly see you — close enough to trigger your deepest fears of abandonment, betrayal, engulfment, or loss — the defenses crack open and the soul's actual condition is revealed.

This means that the suffering in relationships is not a sign that you have chosen the wrong person or that love itself is flawed. It is the soul confronting the karmic residue of everything it has not yet resolved. The partner who triggers your most irrational reactions is often the partner whose presence activates patterns laid down across multiple lifetimes — patterns of control, surrender, betrayal, or enmeshment that the soul must now bring to consciousness if it is to evolve beyond them. Green's question is simultaneously compassionate and unsparing: given everything your soul has experienced in relationships across incarnations, what is it being asked to learn now, and are you willing to let the relationship teach you?

## The Evolutionary Framework

Green constructs his relational framework on the architecture established in Volume I but adds several dimensions specific to how two souls interact. The foundation remains the same: Pluto represents the soul's deepest desire, the polarity point represents the evolutionary direction, the south node describes accumulated karmic patterns, and the north node points toward the growth this lifetime requires. What Volume II adds is the recognition that all of these dynamics are activated, amplified, and often distorted the moment you enter an intimate relationship with another soul carrying its own equally complex evolutionary blueprint.

The first new dimension is the evolutionary state of the relationship itself. Just as individual souls exist along a spectrum from consensus through individuated to spiritual, relationships move through developmental stages that Green characterizes as dependence, independence, and interdependence. In the dependent stage, you seek in the other person what you have not developed in yourself — security, identity, validation, the sense that you exist only when reflected in someone else's eyes. In the independent stage, you have reclaimed enough of your own center to stand alone, but the pendulum may swing toward isolation, emotional self-sufficiency as armor, the refusal to need anyone because need once brought devastation. In the interdependent stage, two people who have each done enough individual work to be genuinely whole choose to create something together that neither could create alone — a relationship in which vulnerability is possible because it is no longer confused with annihilation.

Green layers this developmental model onto his planetary framework by showing how Venus and Mars function as soul-level indicators of relational desire and value. Venus in the evolutionary system does not simply describe what attracts you. It describes what the soul values at the deepest level, the kind of connection it has been seeking across lifetimes, and the karmic patterns embedded in how it has pursued that connection. Mars describes how the soul asserts its desires in relationship — through direct confrontation, passive withdrawal, sexual intensity, intellectual challenge — and the evolutionary work involves bringing that assertion into alignment with the soul's actual growth direction rather than repeating the strategies of previous incarnations.

## Deep Dive: Evolutionary Themes

### Pluto in the Relational Houses: Where the Soul Meets the Other

When Pluto occupies the houses most directly associated with relationship — the fifth, seventh, and eighth — the soul's evolutionary work is inseparable from the experience of intimacy. These placements indicate that the soul has been working on the theme of human connection across many lifetimes, and the patterns accumulated through that work are both the source of relational depth and the root of relational suffering.

Pluto in the seventh house describes a soul that has been learning through partnership for a very long time. The accumulated experience includes lifetimes in which the other person was the central organizing reality — relationships so intense that they became the defining context of the soul's existence. The karmic residue may include patterns of merging so completely with a partner that the separate self was lost, relationships structured around power and control, or the experience of betrayal so devastating that the soul carries a deep ambivalence about letting anyone close again. The evolutionary intention in this lifetime is not to avoid relationship but to transform how you relate. The polarity point in the first house demands the development of an independent identity that can enter partnership without disappearing into it. You are learning to be with another person while remaining yourself — a task that sounds simple and is, for this soul, the work of lifetimes.

Pluto in the eighth house intensifies the relational dynamic to its extreme. Here the soul's desire is for total merger — emotional, sexual, psychological, financial — and the past-life experience includes relationships in which that merger was both ecstatic and destructive. The soul knows what it means to fuse with another person at the deepest level, and it also knows what it means to be annihilated by that fusion. The karmic patterns may include the use of sexuality as power, the manipulation of shared resources as a means of control, or the experience of having your most intimate vulnerabilities used against you. The evolutionary direction, through the polarity point in the second house, asks you to develop a relationship with your own values, your own resources, your own embodied self-worth that does not depend on what anyone else gives you or withholds from you. The soul must learn that intimacy is not the same as possession, and that the deepest connection between two people requires that each of them has something of their own to bring.

Pluto in the fifth house brings the evolutionary dynamic into the realm of creative self-expression, romance, and children. The soul has been working on the theme of being seen — of expressing its unique identity through creative acts, romantic encounters, and the experience of generating new life. The karmic patterns may include the confusion of love with performance, the need for constant external validation, or relationships organized around the drama of pursuit and conquest rather than the quieter work of genuine intimacy. The evolutionary direction through the polarity point in the eleventh house asks this soul to move beyond purely personal love into a wider understanding of connection — to discover that the creative energy it has been channeling through individual romance can also serve collective purposes, and that the deepest recognition comes not from a single admiring other but from finding your place within a community of equals.

### Venus and Mars as Soul-Level Indicators

Green's treatment of Venus and Mars in Volume II represents one of the book's most original contributions. Rather than reading these planets as simple indicators of attraction type and desire style, he treats them as carriers of the soul's relational karma — the accumulated patterns of how you have loved and wanted across incarnations.

Venus by house and sign describes the specific way your soul has learned to seek connection. Venus in Scorpio, for example, does not simply mean you are attracted to intensity. It means the soul has been seeking love through depth, through the willingness to go beneath the surface, through experiences of emotional and sexual merging that transform both partners. The karmic dimension of this placement may include lifetimes in which the pursuit of depth became entangled with possessiveness, jealousy, or the attempt to control the beloved through emotional intensity. The evolutionary work involves learning to hold the desire for deep connection without allowing it to become a demand for ownership — to love with penetrating honesty while leaving the other person free.

Venus in Libra carries a very different relational history. The soul has been learning about partnership through the values of equality, harmony, and aesthetic appreciation. The karmic patterns may include a tendency to sacrifice authenticity for the sake of peace, to suppress difficult emotions because they threaten the beautiful surface of the relationship, or to define your own worth entirely through another person's response to you. The growth direction asks you to discover that genuine harmony requires the willingness to be disharmonious when truth demands it, and that a relationship built on the avoidance of conflict is not peaceful but hollow.

Mars functions as the complement to Venus — where Venus describes what the soul values in relationship, Mars describes how it pursues what it wants. Mars in Aries in the relational context represents a soul that has learned to go after what it desires with direct, unmediated force. The karmic residue may include lifetimes of taking what you wanted without regard for the other person's autonomy, or conversely, of being the target of someone else's unboundaried desire. The evolutionary work involves learning to assert yourself in relationship without running over the person you are relating to — to bring the full force of your wanting into the space between you and another human being without mistaking intensity for intimacy.

Mars in Cancer describes a soul whose relational desire operates through emotional need, through the impulse to nurture and protect, through the often unconscious attempt to create security by making yourself indispensable to another person. The karmic dimension may include patterns of passive-aggressive control — meeting your needs by making others dependent on you, expressing anger through emotional withdrawal rather than direct confrontation. The growth direction asks you to learn that genuine caretaking requires first taking care of yourself, and that the desire to protect another person can become a prison for both of you if it is driven by the fear of being alone.

### Synastry as Evolutionary Encounter

Green's approach to synastry — the comparison of two natal charts — departs fundamentally from traditional compatibility analysis. He is not interested in whether your Venus trine their Moon means you will be happy together. He is interested in why two specific souls have arranged to meet at this particular moment in their respective evolutionary journeys, and what the meeting is designed to catalyze.

The first principle is that planetary contacts between two charts describe the specific points of evolutionary activation between two souls. When your Pluto conjuncts another person's Venus, the relationship will involve a profound transformation of how that person experiences love, value, and intimacy. The conjunction does not merely create attraction. It creates a crucible in which everything the Venus person thought they knew about love is broken down and reconstituted. This can be experienced as the most intense love of a lifetime or as the most devastating. Often it is both, because the transformation Pluto demands does not consult your preferences about how it should feel.

When your Saturn squares another person's Moon, the relationship carries a specific karmic weight around the theme of emotional security. The Saturn person may feel a sense of responsibility toward the Moon person that borders on compulsion — a need to contain, structure, or even restrict the Moon person's emotional expression. The Moon person may experience this as oppressive and cold, or as the stability they have always craved, depending on the evolutionary condition of both souls. The square ensures that the dynamic will generate friction, and the friction is the mechanism through which both people are asked to grow — the Saturn person toward greater emotional warmth, the Moon person toward greater emotional self-sufficiency.

Green reads the nodal axis contacts in synastry as the most direct indicators of karmic connection between two souls. When your south node conjuncts another person's personal planet, the relationship carries the unmistakable feeling of recognition — the sense that you have known this person before, that the connection predates this lifetime. Green reads this literally: the souls have met before, and the current encounter is a continuation of unfinished business. The evolutionary question is whether the relationship will merely re-enact the old pattern or use the familiarity as a foundation for the new growth both souls require. The south node conjunction can create a gravitational pull so strong that it traps both people in a repetition of past dynamics, or it can provide the deep trust needed to do genuinely difficult evolutionary work together. Which outcome unfolds depends on the consciousness each person brings to the encounter.

### The Composite Chart as Relationship Soul

One of the most distinctive features of Volume II is Green's treatment of the composite chart — the chart created by calculating the midpoints of all planetary positions in two natal charts — as an indicator of the relationship's own evolutionary purpose. The composite chart does not describe either person. It describes the entity that comes into existence when they meet, the third thing that is neither you nor your partner but the relationship itself.

Green reads Pluto in the composite chart as the indicator of the relationship's deepest purpose. Composite Pluto in the ninth house, for example, suggests that the relationship exists to expand both partners' understanding of truth — through shared philosophical exploration, through travel, through the challenge of integrating two different belief systems into a coherent shared worldview. The south node of the composite chart reveals the relationship's karmic inheritance — the patterns the two souls have enacted together in previous lifetimes, the default dynamics they will fall into unless conscious effort is made to evolve beyond them. The north node reveals the relationship's growth direction — the new territory it must explore if it is to fulfill its evolutionary purpose rather than merely recycling its past.

This is a profoundly different way of thinking about what a relationship is for. In conventional synastry, the question is whether two people can get along. In Green's framework, the question is what the relationship is designed to accomplish in the evolutionary development of both souls. Some relationships are designed to heal old wounds. Some are designed to catalyze crises that force both people to grow in directions they would never have chosen voluntarily. Some exist for a season and complete their purpose in a matter of months. Others carry an evolutionary agenda that takes decades to unfold. The composite chart, in Green's reading, is the map of that agenda.

### Karmic Re-enactment and the Path to Interdependence

Perhaps the most practically relevant theme in the book is Green's analysis of why you keep attracting the same type of relationship — why the specific pattern of pain you experience with one partner reappears, often with eerie precision, in the next partner and the one after that. The conventional explanation is that you have a "type" rooted in childhood conditioning. Green does not dismiss this but places it within a vastly larger context: the type is rooted in the soul's accumulated relational history across many lifetimes, and childhood merely reactivates patterns that were already in place when you arrived.

The mechanism Green describes works through what he calls karmic re-enactment. The soul carries into each new life a set of unresolved relational dynamics — experiences of betrayal that created a deep distrust of vulnerability, experiences of abandonment that created an equally deep terror of being alone, experiences of control that created a pattern of either dominating or submitting in intimate connection. These patterns are not intellectual. They live in the emotional body, in the instinctive reactions that fire before the conscious mind has time to intervene. When you meet someone who activates the pattern — someone whose chart contacts your own in the precise configuration needed to trigger the old wound — the re-enactment begins. You feel the pull of recognition. You experience the intensity as destiny. And before you are fully aware of what is happening, you are living the old story again.

Green is careful to distinguish between re-enactment that leads nowhere and re-enactment that becomes a vehicle for growth. The difference lies entirely in consciousness. If you enter the familiar dynamic unconsciously, you will replay it to its familiar conclusion — the same betrayal, the same abandonment, the same collapse. But if you enter it with awareness of what is happening, if you recognize the pattern as it activates and choose to respond differently than you have in every previous lifetime, the re-enactment becomes a portal. The old energy is released not by avoiding it but by meeting it with a new response. This is how the soul moves from dependence through independence to genuine interdependence — not by finding a different kind of partner but by becoming a different kind of person within the same relational field.

The three stages of relational evolution — dependence, independence, interdependence — map onto Green's broader evolutionary scheme in a way that gives them practical specificity. In the dependent stage, which correlates roughly with the consensus evolutionary condition, you need the relationship to provide what you have not developed in yourself. The partner is parent, mirror, source of identity, and the loss of the relationship feels like the loss of the self. In the independent stage, which correlates with the individuated condition, you have reclaimed enough of your own center to survive without a relationship, but the self-sufficiency may harden into emotional isolation — the soul that once lost itself in merger now refuses to merge at all, mistaking defensive separateness for strength. In the interdependent stage, which correlates with the spiritual condition, two people who have each completed enough of their individual work can enter a relationship that is not driven by need or defended against vulnerability but grounded in the choice to grow together — to allow the other person's presence to reveal what you cannot see alone, and to offer the same gift in return.

### Pluto Aspects in Relational Context

Green devotes extensive attention to how Pluto's aspects to Venus and Mars function specifically in the context of intimate relationship, and these sections contain some of the book's most psychologically acute material.

Pluto-Venus aspects describe a soul whose experience of love has been shaped by transformative intensity across many lifetimes. The conjunction indicates that love and power have been fused — that the soul has known relationships in which the experience of loving someone was inseparable from the experience of being changed by them, often painfully. The past-life patterns may include relationships in which love was used as a means of control, in which beauty or sexual attractiveness became a currency of power, or in which the loss of a beloved was so devastating that the soul developed an elaborate system of defenses designed to ensure that such vulnerability would never be risked again. The evolutionary work involves allowing the old defenses to soften — learning to love with the full intensity Pluto demands while releasing the need to control the outcome. The square between Pluto and Venus creates a tension between the desire for love and the fear of what love requires — a push-pull dynamic in which the person simultaneously craves and sabotages intimacy, drawn toward vulnerability and terrified of it in equal measure. The opposition projects the transformative dynamic onto the partner: you experience the other person as the agent of your destruction or your rebirth, and the work involves recognizing that the power you attribute to them actually lives within you.

Pluto-Mars aspects bring the evolutionary dynamic into the realm of desire, sexuality, and the assertion of will within relationship. The conjunction fuses desire with the compulsion to transform — the soul desires with an intensity that frightens both itself and its partners, and the sexual expression of this desire carries a depth that goes far beyond physical pleasure into territory that is psychological and spiritual. The karmic patterns may include the use of sexuality as domination, the experience of sexual violation, or the discovery that the most intense desire you have ever felt is entangled with the most intense fear. The evolutionary direction asks the soul to bring its desire into consciousness — to stop acting it out compulsively and start choosing how to express the enormous energy Mars-Pluto generates. The square creates a crisis in which desire and power are in open conflict, often manifesting as relationships organized around struggle — who controls whom, who submits, who wins. The evolutionary intention behind the conflict is the integration of power and desire into a form that empowers both partners rather than diminishing either.

## Among the Schools

Green's understanding of relationships in Volume II occupies territory that neither traditional nor psychological astrology has fully claimed. Traditional astrology approaches relationships through planetary dignities, essential qualities, and the assessment of compatibility based on whether two charts form harmonious or discordant aspects. The question is structural: do these two charts fit together, and what can be predicted about the outcome? Psychological astrology, as developed by Liz Greene in her landmark work on the subject, reads relationships as theaters of projection — the partner carries what you have disowned, and the relationship becomes the arena in which your shadow, your anima or animus, and your unlived life are encountered in embodied form. The question is intrapsychic: what is this relationship revealing about your own unconscious?

Green asks a different question entirely. He asks what brought these two souls together across the span of multiple lifetimes, what evolutionary purpose the meeting serves, and what both souls are being asked to learn through the specific dynamics the relationship generates. This shifts the center of gravity from personality to soul, from the psychology of a single lifetime to the karmic arc of many, and from the analysis of projection to the understanding of evolutionary intention. A psychological astrologer reading a difficult Pluto-Venus contact in synastry will explore the power dynamics and shadow projections it activates. Green reads the same contact and sees two souls who have agreed, at a level deeper than conscious choice, to enter a crucible of transformation together — and his interpretive task is to discern what the transformation is meant to produce.

## Chart Practice

To apply Green's relational framework, begin with both natal charts and locate Pluto in each. Consider what each person's soul most deeply desires in relationship and where the accumulated karmic patterns around that desire are likely to create difficulty. Then overlay the charts and look for the contacts that carry the heaviest evolutionary weight: Pluto contacts to the other person's personal planets, nodal axis contacts, and Saturn contacts that indicate karmic obligation.

If your Pluto conjuncts your partner's Moon, recognize that the relationship will involve a fundamental transformation of how your partner experiences emotional security. Your presence in their life activates their deepest emotional patterns, and the intensity of their reactions to you — both positive and negative — reflects the depth of the evolutionary work being catalyzed. Your task is not to manage their emotions but to remain conscious of the power you carry in the relationship and to wield it with awareness rather than compulsion.

Calculate the composite chart and locate its Pluto, south node, and north node. The composite south node reveals the default dynamic the relationship falls into without conscious effort — the old story that feels so familiar it seems inevitable. The composite north node reveals the new territory the relationship must explore to fulfill its evolutionary purpose. If the composite south node is in the fourth house and the north node is in the tenth, the relationship's habitual pattern involves withdrawal into private emotional intensity, and its growth direction involves bringing that intensity into the world — building something together that has public form and visible consequence.

Throughout this process, assess the evolutionary condition of both people. The same synastry contact means something very different depending on whether both partners are in the dependent, independent, or interdependent stage of relational evolution. A Pluto-Venus conjunction between two people in the dependent stage may produce an obsessive, consuming dynamic that neither person can see clearly enough to work with consciously. The same aspect between two people approaching interdependence may become the foundation for a relationship of extraordinary depth and mutual transformation.

## The Limits of This Framework

The concepts that give this book its power — soul mates, karmic relationships, past-life dynamics between partners — are also the concepts most vulnerable to misuse. The idea that your current partner is someone you were betrayed by in a previous life can become a way of explaining away legitimate present-tense grievances, of reframing a bad relationship as spiritually necessary rather than simply harmful. Green is aware of this danger and repeatedly emphasizes that the purpose of understanding relational karma is not to endure abuse in the name of soul growth but to recognize patterns clearly enough to make conscious choices about them.

The framework's reliance on past-life assumptions remains empirically unverifiable. You cannot confirm that the sense of recognition you feel with a particular person is the result of previous incarnation contact rather than a projection shaped by childhood attachment patterns and neurobiological chemistry. The system produces interpretations that feel deeply meaningful to those who share its premises and ungrounded to those who do not. The practical value of the framework — its capacity to illuminate relational patterns with remarkable specificity — does not depend on whether the metaphysical claims are literally true, but the reader must decide for themselves how much ontological weight to assign to the evolutionary narrative.

## Further Reading

Green's own *Pluto: The Evolutionary Journey of the Soul* is the necessary companion, establishing the complete interpretive system that Volume II extends into relationships. Steven Forrest's *Yesterday's Sky* offers a complementary nodal approach to past-life dynamics in chart work. Deva Green's *Evolutionary Astrology* codifies the framework for students. Liz Greene's *Relating* provides the richest psychological counterpoint, exploring relationship through the lens of Jungian projection rather than evolutionary intention. For the composite chart specifically, Robert Hand's *Planets in Composite* remains the standard technical reference that pairs usefully with Green's evolutionary reading of the same material.

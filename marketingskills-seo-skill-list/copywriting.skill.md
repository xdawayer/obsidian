## Prompt structure deep dive

   - Gather page purpose, audience, product, and traffic context.
2. Principles and Style Rules
   - Clarity, benefits, specificity, customer language.
3. Page Structure Framework
   - Hero, social proof, pain, benefits, how it works, objections, CTA.
4. Section Variety

7. Related Skills

## Best-fit use cases
- “Write landing page copy that also needs SEO meta.”
- “Add an FAQ section for organic intent coverage.”
- “Refresh copy after SEO-driven traffic changes.”

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Capture context
   - Include traffic source and what visitors already know.
2. Draft the core story
   - Lead with value prop, then build problem, solution, proof, CTA.
3. Add SEO-friendly elements
   - Provide page title and meta description if relevant.
   - Include FAQ section when it reduces objections and supports discovery.
4. Provide alternatives
   - Offer multiple headline and CTA options with rationale.
5. Polish
   - Run copy through copy-editing for a final sweep.

## Output expectations

- Meta title and meta description when requested or relevant.

## Pitfalls to avoid
- Ignoring traffic context (organic vs paid).
- Skipping meta content when SEO is a goal.
- Overloading the page with sections without a clear flow.

## When to pair with other skills
- seo-audit: when rankings are the primary concern.
- competitor-alternatives: when comparison copy is needed.
- schema-markup: if FAQ schema will be added.

## Scope in one line
Apply mental models to marketing decisions, including SEO strategy and long-term compounding.

## Prompt structure deep dive
1. How to Use This Skill

## Best-fit use cases
- “SEO growth stalled. What should we focus on?”
- “How should we think about long-term content compounding?”
- “Which mental models apply to organic acquisition?”

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Define the SEO decision
   - Traffic plateau, content scaling, or conversion drop from organic.
2. Select relevant models
   - Theory of Constraints, Pareto (80/20), Feedback Loops, Compounding.
3. Translate models into actions
   - Identify bottlenecks, focus on the highest-leverage pages, build loops.
4. Apply ethically
   - Avoid manipulative tactics and keep recommendations user-first.
5. Measure and iterate
   - Track outcomes and test assumptions with experiments.

## Output expectations
- 3-5 models mapped to the SEO problem with concrete applications.
- Ethical guardrails and measurable next steps.

## Pitfalls to avoid
- Using models as slogans instead of diagnosis tools.
- Optimizing local metrics while the real bottleneck remains.

## When to pair with other skills
- seo-audit: identify concrete technical constraints.
- programmatic-seo: scale once the loop is proven.
- analytics-tracking: measure compounding effects.

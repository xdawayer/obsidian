## Scope in one line
Design scalable SEO page systems that rank without thin content penalties.

## Prompt structure deep dive
1. Initial Assessment
   - Business context, opportunity size, competition.
2. Core Principles
   - Unique value per page, proprietary data, subfolders, intent match, quality at scale.

4. Choosing Playbook
   - Match to assets; combine playbooks to increase differentiation.
5. Implementation Framework
   - Keyword pattern research → data schema → template design → internal linking → indexation strategy.
6. Quality Checks
   - Pre-launch checklist and post-launch monitoring.
7. Common Mistakes
   - Thin content, cannibalization, over-generation, bad data, poor UX.
8. Output Format
   - Strategy doc, template structure, launch checklist.
9. Questions & Related Skills
   - seo-audit, schema-markup, analytics-tracking, copywriting.

## Best-fit use cases
- “We want to build 1,000 location pages.”
- “Create an integrations directory for SEO.”
- “Scale comparison pages for competitors.”

## How to use (step-by-step)
1. Identify keyword patterns
   - Define variables, estimate total pages, validate volume and intent.
2. Audit competition and feasibility
   - Evaluate ranking difficulty and content quality needed to win.
3. Define data requirements
   - Choose data sources (first-party preferred), design schema per page type.
4. Choose playbook(s)

6. Build internal linking architecture
   - Hub pages, breadcrumbs, cross-links, sitemaps.
7. Plan indexation strategy
   - Prioritize high-value pages; noindex thin variants.
8. Run pre-launch quality checks
   - Unique titles, schema, CWV, canonicals, crawlability.
9. Launch and monitor
   - Track indexation, ranking by pattern, engagement, conversions.

## Output expectations
- Opportunity analysis (pattern, volume, competition).
- Implementation plan (data, template, linking, technical stack).
- Content guidelines and uniqueness rules.
- Concrete page template (URL, title, meta, H1, outline, schema).

## Pitfalls to avoid
- Variable swapping without unique value.
- Creating thousands of pages with no demand.
- Subdomains that split domain authority.

## When to pair with other skills
- seo-audit: validate large template pages post-launch.
- schema-markup: add structured data at scale.
- copywriting: non-templated copy and positioning.
